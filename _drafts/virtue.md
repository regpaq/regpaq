Before learning about [philosophy](/philosophy), I thought the level of impact someone makes on the world was the best objective way to measure whether someone had lived a meaningful life or not.

And with my interests and skillset, I think I have the most potential to make the biggest impact from starting a company.

And if this is what defines a meaningful life from a meaningless one, then I have a problem:

**Each day that passes where I'm not running a successful and impactful company, I feel I'm living in a continual state of insignificance and meaninglessness.**

Although this view can be depressing, I can't reason or justify a better measurement for meaning. I'd rather accept this as a harsh reality than believe in something else that might make me feel better, yet isn't true.

That's why it was surprising to read how strong [Marcus Aurelius](/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes), the famous Stoic philosopher, thought accepting fate and doing good as the two most important things he could do in his life. He wrote:

> "No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be good. Like gold or emerald or purple repeating to itself, “No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be emerald, my color undiminished.”
> > Marcus Aurelius, [Meditations 7.15](/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes)

Not only that, he believed legacy and being remembered, which could be argued is a result of an impactful life, was essentially meaningless in the grand scheme of human history.

> "So many who were remembered already forgotten, and those who remembered them long gone."
> > Marcus Aurelius, [Meditations 7.6](/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes)
{: .big-quote}

His work continues to be a radically positive influence on my own philosophy and character, but I'm still not completely convinced living according to fate and being virtuous results in a meaningful life on its own.

**This article will be like a thought exercise where I work through and unpack this idea and see if I can make sense of it.** Perhaps it can change my view as I begin to understand it.

In this introduction, I briefly touched on my personal philosophy and how Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism view things differently. Before moving on to see what they think, I want to expand and clarify a few concepts from my philosophy to make it easier to compare and contrast our ideas.

## The Difference Between Life's Purpose, a Meaningful Life, and Impact

### The pupose of life

Typically when people think about this topic, they think of the purpose of life, so I want to address it. **I don't think there is a purpose of life.** Purpose could refer to a collective purpose of human life. Or it could refer to the purpose of an individual's life implying we have a predetermined reason for why each one of us are alive. I don't think either of these are true. "Why are we here?" is the wrong question to ask.

Instead of thinking we have a purpose to fulfill in life, I argue we have a goal to achieve. This article is an attempt to determine what that goal is.

### A meaningful life

A possible goal that I believe makes the most sense is to do something meaningful. **What determines a meaningful life from a meaningless one is difficult to define.** According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, meaning is defined as "significant quality." In order to understand what a life of significant quality is, we need two things: 1) to accept there are significant and insignificant lives, and 2) a way to determine one from the other.

### An impactful life

**One possible measurement for determining if a life is of significant quality or of insignificant quality is by the level of impact one had made in their life.** And impact can be defined as making a change, difference, or being an influence on something, but it's unclear how signficant that something must be in order to "qualify" as a substantial enough impact.

I see four levels of impact.

1. in the individual
2. on the family
3. on the community
4. on the world

If impact is a useful metric for measuring meaning, the question here would be at which of these levels would one have to make an impact for their life to have a material meaning?

Although I haven't even yet demonstrated meaning is a worthwhile objective in life or whether impact is a valid measurement for meaning, let's move on to see what Marcus Aurelius thought before continuing down this path.

## What Matters According to Marcus Aurelius

I'm not sure if Marcus Aurelius ever believed such a thing existed as a "meaningful" life. He often wrote to himself not to indulge in pleasures, not to fear death as it was inevitable, and to live according to nature (fate). One meditation sticks out to me about this:

### Life is potentially meaningless

> "A rock thrown in the air. It loses nothing by coming down, gained nothing by going up."
> > Marcus Aurelius, [Meditations 9.17](/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes)

I didn't understand his point of view immediately, especially because I had been hell bent on growing in my career. But I came to realize that mentality had made me miserable. I became selfish, fake, and manipulative. It backfired. I ended up digressing in my career and relationships.

### Legacy doesn't last

### It doesn't matter whether people like you or not

### Death is inevitable

As I read more about philosophy through Bertrand Russell's [History of Western Philosophy](https://amzn.to/2Olnlgo){:target="_blank"}, and in particular learning about Aristotle and his work on ethics, I'm beginning to understand the practical benefits of virtue. Before I get any further, here's the main virtues from Aristotle.

## List of Virtues and Vices from Aristotle

Aristotle was the first philosopher to formalize the study of a person's character. He called it ēthikós (ethics).

His ideas and work on the subject were published in a collection of ten short books called [Nicomachean Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics){:target=“_blank”}.

I haven't read the direct text yet, but his idea of describing virtue as a mean between two vices of deficiency and excess is recognized as one of his greatest contributions to philosophy.

| Situation            | Vice of Deficiency  | Virtue                | Vice of Excess |
|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Danger               | Cowardice           | Courage               | Rashness       |
| Pleasure and Pain    | Inhibition          | Temperance            | Overindulgence |
| Getting and Spending | Illiberality        | Liberality            | Prodigality    |
| Getting and Spending | Pettiness           | Magnificence          | Vulgairty      |
| Honor and Dishonor   | Pusillanimity       | Magnanimity           | Vanity         |
| Anger                | Apathy              | Patience              | Irascibility   |
| Self Expression      | Understatement      | Truthfulness          | Boastfulness   |
| Conversation         | Boorishness         | Wittiness             | Buffoonery     |
| Social Conduct       | Rudeness            | Friendliness          | Obsequiousness |
| Shame                | Shamelessness       | Modesty               | Shyness        |
| Indignation          | Malicious enjoyment | Righteous indignation | Envy           |

## Does Living a Virtuous Life Bring Happiness?
Living virtuously is difficult. It takes self control, sacrifice, patience, and practice. Attempting to be more virtuous, I started approaching my relationships, work, and problems. It's a challening process. Like quitting a bad habit and having withdrawls. **But what has become instantly clear to me, without a doubt, is that living virtuously prevents unhappiness.**

> "What is the goal of virtue, after all, except a life that flows smoothly?"
> > Epictetus, Book I, 108
