    <div id="t1" class="testimonial visible"><p>“In the time that I got to work with Reggie, the results he brought to the organization were undeniable. He’s creative in how he approaches marketing campaigns and is one of the few marketers I’ve worked with who can find inefficient processes and drastically improve them with automation. He works hard, follows through on what he says he will do, and has always been a great coworker to collaborate with. Any marketing team would be lucky to have Reggie on their team!”</p>

<div id="t2" class="testimonial hidden"><p>“Reggie has been an invaluable part of the ServiceTitan team for over two years. I’ve enjoyed working with him and watching him grow as a marketer. Reggie is a true asset to any growing marketing team in a start-up environment. He has a deep knowledge of marketing automation and has become skilled in adwords and SEO. By far, though, Reggie’s biggest asset to the team has been his ability to find and implement new tools to solve specific business problems. He combines a love of marketing and technology with a keen interest in optimizing systems. This served us well on multiple project he drove: launching our Facebook ad instance (which grew into our biggest channel on his watch), implementing a chat bot on our website and automating the lead capture with both Hubspot and SFDC, and building out a robust demo request form automation that captured data from leads, pushed it through Hubspot and into SFDC, and alerted the SDR team of new leads in the queue. It’s been great to watch Reggie grow as he’s tackled bigger and bigger projects over his time at ServiceTitan, and always with an eye to drive value with each initiative.”</p>

<div id="t3" class="testimonial hidden"><p>“Reggie has a very unique ability as a marketer to not just stay in his bubble, or only see things from a marketing point of view. Rather he does a great job of working cross-functionally, and also coming up with ideas that will have a positive impact across the company, not just his Org.</p>

<p>Whether it’s split testing, conversion rate optimization, keywords, organic, whatever, he can do it, do it fast, and do it well. I also like his eye for metrics, no vanity metrics coming from this guy!</p>

<p>He has a ongoing desire to continue to learn, and we had many conversations on different books, conferences, and techniques to improve the marketing program. Something else that is great with working with Reggie is understanding and quick implementation of technology, there were more times I cant where I said “Hey Reggie can you help me with this” and his response was “Already done KD, continue along your merry way”</p>

<p>He is an incredibly talented, proactive and intelligent marketer that I would GLADLY work with again at any time.”</p>

His ability to get his own work done but also contribute and nurture growth amongst his teammates is truly an outstanding gift. He tackles each project with hyper focus, incredible time management, and the ability to align multiple players on the same playing field, yet is still able to have his creative voice and talent permeate through the brand and image. What amazes me most about Reggie is his ability to make everything seem so effortless, and time and time again he is always there to save the day. You can have a laugh with Reggie all while learning so much from him, and I don’t take for granted the skills he shared with me!”</p>

Reggie successfully lead eCommerce companies out of the red and into the black in terms of revenue generated from digital marketing efforts. He lead high-performing inbound marketing campaigns from ideation to execution, but wouldn’t stop there. The real glory shone from his work when he was able to analyze the results of his efforts and apply them to subsequent campaigns.</p>

<p>However, Reggie’s expertise goes beyond measurable results. I can sincerely say that I’ve never met anyone who is as immersed in the world of inbound marketing as Reggie is. Anyone who has the privilege of working with Reggie can see that he has an infectious passion for inbound marketing. He lives and breathes it. He wouldn’t be satisfied with his work unless it produced the highest caliber results, and it consistently would. He brought fresh insight to the table, implemented the use mission-critical analytics tools, and built foundational processes for a newly founded inbound marketing team.”</p>
