After I graduated college, I received an inheritance check for $30k. **About a year later it was gone.**

I used the money to move out, get a new car, eat out constantly — all while telling myself I’m going to be making $10k a month before I know it as freelance marketer.

Yeah, that didn’t work out ([but didn’t turn out so bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/9qsktw/i_made_130k_with_year_as_a_b2b_marketer_in_saas/){:target="_blank"}).

> Every month I knew I was spending more than I was making, but I was too scared to look at my bank account or my credit card statement. Just click pay.

**It took me wasting all my money and having only one month left to survive on my own to push me to get a real job and start budgeting.** If you can learn from my mistakes, you won’t need to let it get this bad for you.

How did I get my finances back on track? As you can tell by the title, **it was from creating a budget and sticking to it**. It has changed my life and reduced a lot of stress. I'm hope I'll be able to help other people facing the same stress I had by turning my personal monthly budget Google Sheet into a template and sharing it here.

**Here is my number one tip: First get your mindset right and understand what a budget is REALLY for.**

> The ultimate goal of a budget is NOT to see where your money is going, but to create a change in your behavior to spend less money on stupid shit.

## The Reason Doing Your Monthly Budget on Google Sheets Will Drive Behavior Change to Spend Less

It forces you to enter your expenses manually. Although seemingly tedious, I found it to be the most important exercise.

> Entering expenses manually forces you to review every transaction, to feel the pain of every dollar spent — that is what will drive a change in your spending.
{: .big-quote}

And something tools like Mint that try and automate everything are terrible at doing.

**The other benefit is you’re forced to self categorize each transaction, which means they’ll be more accurate and useful for budgeting.**

I’ve been using Google Sheets to manage my personal budget for nearly five years now. And after much tinkering and revisions, it’s the most beautiful and easiest to use I’ve made yet.

## Download My Simple Google Sheets Budget Template

### Here’s How It Works

I made the budget template with easy-to-follow orange prompts to make it super simple to get started.

Start with entering your income, annual budget, and monthly budget data to get started. Then enter your bank account, other assets, credit cards, loans etc to get your financial picture. All that’s left is entering expense data and that’s it.

**Everything else other than entering expenses is automated.**

Once you’ve been using it for a few months and get some data in there (or even better enter historical data) you can use this chart to see how you’ve been spending vs your budget by each category or in total.

## How to Set Up My Google Sheets Budget Template For Your Use

Once you've copied the budget template, watch this video which contains step-by-step instructions how to use the template and get started.

### Bonus Tips

A budget is only good if you update it consistently, keep it accurate, and spend time analyzing your spending. That’s why I made it a point to make it look nice, be easy to use, and be rewarding.

But sometimes that’s still not enough. **There’s definitely been times where I don’t do it for a few weeks at a time and the more you wait, the more work you’ll have to do, and the more you won’t look forward to it**. I‘ve made it a habit to log my expenses every Sunday vs once every month.

If you believe a budget will help you get control of your spending, read this guide on how to stick to new habits:

{% assign subpage = site.posts | where: 'post-id', '8' %}{% for post in subpage %} {% include rec-article.html %}{% endfor %}

Another tip is to use a credit card for all transactions when possible. Using a credit card makes it much easier to keep track of your spending and at the same time protects your bank account from fraud, builds your credit, and you can earn points and rewards.

Let me know what you think of the spreadsheet. If you found some places where I messed up or have ideas for new functionality, let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/regpaq).
