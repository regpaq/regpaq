&lt;p&gt;You can make your own copy by clicking the link below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The template is based off the principles and concepts from Ramit Sethi’s personal finance book, &lt;em&gt;“I Will Teach You to Be Rich.”&lt;/em&gt; I’ll cover everything you need to know in this post, but if you want to learn more about it, you can read my summary of the book below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-makes-this-google-sheets-budget-template-better-than-the-others-out-there&quot;&gt;What Makes This Google Sheets Budget Template Better Than The Others Out There&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;all-the-setup-is-on-one-page&quot;&gt;All the setup is on one page&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just one configuration tab, you’ll fill out all your info: income, account names, budget, etc. All the other tabs pull data from this &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab so you never have to enter in any information twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-one-page-settings.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-one-page-settings.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-one-page-settings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Once you set up this Config tab, just enter expenses and account balances. That's it!&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Once you set up this Config tab, just enter expenses and account balances. That's it!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;built-in-guided-setup&quot;&gt;Built-in guided setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening up a new Google Sheets budget template with all these numbers and tabs can be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I wanted to create a guided setup to make it super simple for anyone to get started. When you open up the template, you’ll be greeted with easy-to-follow prompts so you know exactly what you need to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;assets/videos/guided-tour.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Bright orange prompts make this the easiest Google Sheets budget template to get set up on.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setup-checklist&quot;&gt;Setup checklist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the configuration settings, the checklist shows you where to go next in the template to enter your expenses and account balances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-setup-checklist.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-setup-checklist.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-setup-checklist.png&quot; alt=&quot;The setup checklist will automatically mark things complete as you finish each step.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The setup checklist will automatically mark things complete as you finish each step.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one-dashboard-to-rule-them-all&quot;&gt;One dashboard to rule them all&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Google Sheets budget template has four tabs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; - the main tab where you can see your spending vs budget for the current month and analyze previous months’ spending. All the data is pulled from the other tabs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expenses&lt;/strong&gt; - where you enter all your expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt; - to record your bank account, retirement account, credit card and loan balances, etc. This data is used to help measure whether your net worth is increasing or shrinking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; - as explained above, this is where you fill out your income, name your accounts, and set your budgets, which is used in all the other tabs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll spend most of your time in the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;The dashboard is the clearest way to see where you're spending your money.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The dashboard is the clearest way to see where you're spending your money.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;always-know-how-much-of-your-monthly-budget-you-have-left&quot;&gt;Always know how much of your monthly budget you have left&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you fill out your expenses, there’s a “module” where you can see exactly how much of a budget category you’ve used so far in the current month and know exactly how much you have left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve overspent in one budget category, the template will let you take remaining budget from another category to cover it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;assets/videos/budget-module.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;This makes it fun to fill out your expenses everyday and it's easy to temporarily take budget from another category to cover one you've overspent in.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;budget-and-keep-track-of-annual-irregular-expenses&quot;&gt;Budget and keep track of annual, irregular expenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The template is also built to accommodate irregular expenses that you might only spend money on or have to pay for a few times a year. Once you enter a list of the things you want to create an annual budget for, the template will calculate how much you need to save per month to cover it. And that amount is deducted before you set up your monthly budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget-module.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget-module.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget-module.png&quot; alt=&quot;This template helps you plan for irregular or annual expenses.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;This template helps you plan for irregular or annual expenses.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spend-your-money-without-feeling-guilty&quot;&gt;Spend your money without feeling guilty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call the monthly budget the &lt;em&gt;“guilt-free budget,”&lt;/em&gt; which is a concept taken from the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://regpaq.com/i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I Will Teach You to Be Rich.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Since the budget template is built to help you put aside money for savings before creating your monthly budget, it means you don’t ever have to feel guilty about spending the money you do have left over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a fundamental shift in my perspective about personal finance Ramit calls &lt;em&gt;paying yourself first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-guilt-free-budget.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-guilt-free-budget.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-guilt-free-budget.png&quot; alt=&quot;After budgeting money for savings and annual expenses, you can budget your discretionary spending, guilt-free.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;After budgeting money for savings and annual expenses, you can budget your discretionary spending, guilt-free.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;built-to-drive-behavioral-change&quot;&gt;Built to drive behavioral change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my friends use a budgeting app like Mint and I’ve tried them, too. But these apps don’t really help me spend less money - they just tell me where I spend my money and try to guess (poorly) the category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I love budgets built on spreadsheets. I can customize it exactly the way I need to actually help me spend my money more thoughtfully. On less of things I care little about, and more on the things I care a lot about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A bad budget system only shows you where your money is going. A good budget system will create a change in your behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FyZvG4UI11Kd-kaVPpUiV5mRjgPz4OERfxak_KXCsgU/copy&quot;&gt;try my Google Sheets budget template&lt;/a&gt;, make a copy of it and try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are simple and clear instructions with extra notes on cells that have an asterisk(*) - just hover over those cells to the see note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re stuck and need more info to get going, read on to get the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-use-my-google-sheets-budget-template&quot;&gt;How to Use My Google Sheets Budget Template&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start on the &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, cells with an asterisk(*) mean there is a note on that cell with more information. Hover over it to see what it says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-enter-your-income&quot;&gt;I. Enter your income&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the top left box on the &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab, enter your income. Follow the orange colored cells as cues for which part to fill out next. If you don’t &lt;strong&gt;contribute to a 401k&lt;/strong&gt; or typically receive any &lt;strong&gt;extra monthly income&lt;/strong&gt;, enter $0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-income.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-income.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-income.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enter your income data in the Income Breakdown box on the Dashbord tab&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Enter your income data in the Income Breakdown box on the Dashbord tab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This budget template is only made for two sources of income. If you have more than one additional source of income, you can count them together and enter the total as one number for your &lt;strong&gt;extra monthly income&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All income entered here will be available for your budget. Before leaving the &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab, you’ll be able to choose how much of it will go into savings, additional retirement accounts, loans, etc, but first you have to name your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-name-your-accounts&quot;&gt;II. Name your accounts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to give a &lt;strong&gt;nickname&lt;/strong&gt; for every type of bank account, asset, and liability you have. The &lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt; is very important to formulas in in the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt; tabs and cannot be changed. If you don’t have an account with the listed &lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt;, leave it blank and skip it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-3&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-bank-account-names.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-bank-account-names.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-bank-account-names.png&quot; alt=&quot;Giving each account you have a nickname tells the budget template you have those accounts.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-asset-names.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-asset-names.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-asset-names.png&quot; alt=&quot;Giving each account you have a nickname tells the budget template you have those accounts.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-liability-names.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-liability-names.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-liability-names.png&quot; alt=&quot;Giving each account you have a nickname tells the budget template you have those accounts.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Giving each account you have a nickname tells the budget template you have those accounts.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have more accounts than what the &lt;strong&gt;types&lt;/strong&gt; have you can count them together as one. For example, if you have four credit cards, you can count two of them together and give &lt;strong&gt;credit card #3&lt;/strong&gt; the nickname &lt;strong&gt;Amex &amp;amp; Citi cards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-create-your-annual-budget&quot;&gt;III. Create your annual budget&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why you create your budget for annual expenses before monthly expenses is so that you’re encouraged to set aside money to be better prepared for irregular expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by adding things you pay for once a year or irregularly in the &lt;strong&gt;Annual Budget&lt;/strong&gt; box. You can find examples and suggestions by hovering over the &lt;strong&gt;budget category*&lt;/strong&gt; cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enter your annual and irregular expenses to prepare for the future.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Enter your annual and irregular expenses to prepare for the future.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you enter in all the annual and irregular expenses you can think of, the budget template will divide the &lt;strong&gt;total&lt;/strong&gt; into a monthly amount inside the &lt;strong&gt;Fixed Monthly Costs&lt;/strong&gt; box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-enter-your-fixed-monthly-costs&quot;&gt;IV. Enter your fixed monthly costs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed Monthly Costs&lt;/strong&gt; are recurring monthly expenses that you don’t expect to change month-to-month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the list is the monthly amount to set aside for your &lt;strong&gt;annual budget&lt;/strong&gt; and the second item is your &lt;strong&gt;after tax retirement&lt;/strong&gt; account. If you have one and gave it a nickname in the &lt;strong&gt;Asset Names&lt;/strong&gt; box, the nickname will be used for this line item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have one or don’t plan on contributing to the one you do have, enter $0 for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-fixed-monthly-costs.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-fixed-monthly-costs.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-fixed-monthly-costs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enter your fixed monthly costs.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Enter your fixed monthly costs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is room for eight additional fixed monthly costs. There are suggestions in the note on the &lt;strong&gt;budget category*&lt;/strong&gt; cell. Along with budgeting for annual expenses and retirement, I highly recommend setting more money aside for extra savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;em&gt;pay yourself first&lt;/em&gt; concept described in &lt;em&gt;“I Will Teach You to Be Rich.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The goal [of pay yourself first] is to make sure that enough income is first saved or invested before monthly expenses or discretionary purchases are made.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payyourselffirst.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Investopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you’re left with your &lt;strong&gt;total for guilt-free budget&lt;/strong&gt;, which is how much you have left for discretionary spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-create-your-guilt-free-monthly-budget&quot;&gt;IV. Create your guilt-free, monthly budget&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained earlier, it’s called your guilt-free budget because this is what is left over after setting money aside for savings, retiremenet, and future annual expenses. This is your money to spend however you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Guilt-Free Budget&lt;/strong&gt; box, enter categories of expenses and an allotted amount. Again, there are suggestions in the note on the &lt;strong&gt;budget category*&lt;/strong&gt; cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-guilt-free-budget.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-guilt-free-budget.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-guilt-free-budget.png&quot; alt=&quot;After budgeting money for savings and annual expenses, you can budget your discretionary spending, guilt-free.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;After budgeting money for savings and annual expenses, you can budget your discretionary spending, guilt-free.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve budgeted over what you have available in your &lt;strong&gt;total for guilt-free budget&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;Fixed Monthly Costs&lt;/strong&gt; box, this &lt;strong&gt;total&lt;/strong&gt; number will turn red and. The number below the &lt;strong&gt;total&lt;/strong&gt; number is how much you have left from your &lt;strong&gt;guilt-free budget&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your monthly and annual budget is now set up! The next step is setting up the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-setting-up-the-balance-sheet&quot;&gt;V. Setting up the balance sheet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going deep into the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;, you just need to enter your start date in the orange cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start date is the first of a month, current or in the past, written as &lt;em&gt;“1/1/2020”&lt;/em&gt;. Once you enter your start date, it will reformat to &lt;em&gt;“Jan ‘20”&lt;/em&gt; and fill the rest of the range for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;assets/videos/dates-on-balance-sheet.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Write the start date in the format of 1/1/2020.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more to do here, but it makes sense to first record your expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-how-to-record-expenses&quot;&gt;V. How to record expenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Expenses&lt;/strong&gt; tab you’ll record your monthly and annual expenses - one row per one expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest presumable downsides of doing your budget in Google Sheets is you have to enter in your expenses manually, but this is a blessing in disguise. Entering your expenses manually has a big and positive psychological effect on your spending behavior. It makes you “feel the pain” of every dollar you spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Manually recording your expenses every week will force you to review every transaction, to feel the pain of every dollar spent, and make you think “was that really necessary?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is you can easily split an expense into two different budget categories, which I’ve found helpful many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;assets/videos/entering-expenses.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Example of how fast you can enter expenses by using the 'tab' and 'enter' keys&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the heading, you’ll see your &lt;strong&gt;guilt-free budget&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;annual budget&lt;/strong&gt; categories from the &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab. When you enter an expense, start with the date in &lt;strong&gt;column a&lt;/strong&gt;, the name of the place you spend the money in &lt;strong&gt;column b&lt;/strong&gt;, and then tab over to the column with the right budget category for that expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and enter all your expenses beginning from the start date you entered on the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t enter expenses or transfers you already accounted for in the &lt;strong&gt;Fixed Monthly Costs&lt;/strong&gt; box on the &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vi-filling-out-the-balance-sheet&quot;&gt;VI. Filling out the balance sheet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once at the beginning of every month you’ll fill out the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt; tab for the previous month. This is where you will add up all the money you have and owe in your accounts so you can see if your wealth and net worth are increasing or shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before moving on, make sure the first three items are marked complete in the &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; checklist on the &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet’s&lt;/strong&gt; sidebar, you’ll see the accounts you’ve named on the &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab. At the beginning of the month when you fill this out, you’ll enter the balances of each account in the previous month’s column. For example, if I was filling this out today on February 7th, I’d enter the balances under the &lt;strong&gt;Jan ‘20&lt;/strong&gt; column. So if you’re starting date is the first of this month, you don’t have to fill out anything until the month is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You only need to enter balances in the white rows. You can skip the greyed out columns (don’t delete them) and don’t overwrite anything with a &lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; in the cell. The dashes indicate a placeholder for a formula and will populate if and when it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enter the previous months' ending balances in each row for the indicated month.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Enter the previous months' ending balances in each row for the indicated month.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Liabilities&lt;/strong&gt; section, you’ll do the same thing as you do with your bank accounts but for your rent/mortgage, loans, and credit cards. If you don’t have a mortgage, enter $0 for the &lt;strong&gt;rent&lt;/strong&gt;. Rent is paid on the 1st of the month so by the end of the month, which these totals are representing, you don’t owe anymore rent. So actually, &lt;strong&gt;rent&lt;/strong&gt; should be $0 for every month in the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you pay a mortgage, then you can enter the mortgage payoff amount in the &lt;strong&gt;mortgage&lt;/strong&gt; row. I do the same with my &lt;strong&gt;car loan&lt;/strong&gt;. When filling out your credit card balances, make sure any pending credit card payments are already reflected in your bank account balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-liabilities.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-liabilities.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-liabilities.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of the Liabilities section with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Example of the Liabilities section with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Monthly Expenses&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Annual Expenses&lt;/strong&gt; sections automatically sum your expenses for that month for each budget category. You can analyze this easier in the the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-expenses.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-expenses.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-expenses.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of the Monthly and Annual Expenses secions with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Example of the Monthly and Annual Expenses secions with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last section is the &lt;strong&gt;Totals&lt;/strong&gt; section, which brings everything together to calculate your &lt;strong&gt;net checking balance&lt;/strong&gt; (money in checking minus current credit card balances) and your &lt;strong&gt;net worth&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last row you can leave notes for yourself if something noteworthy occurred that you might want to come back to. The word “Notes” will auto populate in each month, but to leave an actual note, right-click the &lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt; cell and select “Insert note.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-totals.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-totals.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-totals.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of the Totals section with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Example of the Totals section with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s all you need to do on the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt; tab. As you use this Google Sheets budget template each month, more data on the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; tab will start to populate and be more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vii-using-the-dashboard&quot;&gt;VII. Using the dashboard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to the best part - the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;. This is where you can see the most useful insights for your budget. Except for a small part that I’ll explain below, everything on the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; is automated and you shouldn’t have to change anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top is an &lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt; box with just a few pieces of information to get your overall personal finance health. It’s updated every time a month is filled out on the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt; so if your start date is the first of the current month, you won’t see anything here yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-overview.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-overview.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-overview.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Overview box on the Dashbord tab shows your personal finance health from a bird's eye view.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The Overview box on the Dashbord tab shows your personal finance health from a bird's eye view.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the right of your &lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt; box is a graph of your &lt;strong&gt;Net Worth&lt;/strong&gt; growth. This is pulling the last seven months of data from the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-net-worth.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-net-worth.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-net-worth.png&quot; alt=&quot;Visualize the grow of your net worth over time.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Visualize the grow of your net worth over time.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is my favorite part of the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;This Month’s Budget Spent So Far*&lt;/strong&gt; box. This shows how your spending is doing for the current month compared to your budget for each category. Since I update my &lt;strong&gt;Expenses&lt;/strong&gt; tab every morning, I can see my updated budget here every day so I know exactly how much of my budget I have left for each category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;assets/videos/budget-module.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;This makes it fun to fill out your expenses everyday and it's easy to temporarily take budget from another category to cover one you overspent in.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you overspent in one category, you can subtract &lt;strong&gt;Remaining&lt;/strong&gt; budget from another budget category by subtracting an amount from it in the &lt;strong&gt;Cut Remaining*&lt;/strong&gt; column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the same module for annual expenses below the monthly one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget-module.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget-module.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget-module.png&quot; alt=&quot;Always know exactly how much of your budget you have left of your annual budget for each category.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Always know exactly how much of your budget you have left of your annual budget for each category.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the monthly and the annual &lt;strong&gt;Budget Spent So Far&lt;/strong&gt; boxes will update automatically every month and year respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is the &lt;strong&gt;Spent vs Budget Previous 7 Months*&lt;/strong&gt; box. This is a dynamic graph that compares your spending to your budget for each category. Use the dropdown selector in the top right of the box to look at a specific budget category or look at the total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;assets/videos/spent-vs-budget.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The Spent vs Budget box on the Dashbord tab visualizes your spending for each category.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this graph is only looking at the previous seven completed months. It doesn’t take into account the current months’s spending because it’s not over yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last on the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; tab is the &lt;strong&gt;Expenses Table Previous 7 Months*&lt;/strong&gt; box. This provides the same data as the graph above, but in a table format. Amounts will turn red if you overspent your budget in that category that month. This is a great way to quickly see how you’re doing staying under budget at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-expense-table.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-expense-table.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-expense-table.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Expenses Last 7 Months box shows a table of your spending vs your budget for each category.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The Expenses Last 7 Months box shows a table of your spending vs your budget for each category.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-budgeting-tips&quot;&gt;Bonus Budgeting Tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A budget is only good if you update it consistently, keep it accurate, and spend time analyzing your spending. That’s why I made it a point to make this budget template in Google Sheets look nice, be easy to use, and be rewarding to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes that’s still not enough. &lt;strong&gt;There’s definitely been times where I don’t do it for a few weeks at a time and the more you wait, the more work you’ll have to do, and the more you won’t look forward to doing it&lt;/strong&gt;. I‘ve made it a habit to enter my expenses every morning instead of once a week or month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe a budget will help you get control of your spending, read this guide on how to stick to new habits:&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;        
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tip is to use a credit card for all transactions when possible. Using a credit card makes it much easier to keep track of your spending and at the same time protects your bank account from fraud, builds your credit, and you can earn points and rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most marketers default to using Google Analytics for every website. It’s free, powerful, and the industry standard. Why try anything else, &lt;em&gt;right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-wanted-an-alternative-to-google-analytics&quot;&gt;Why I Wanted an Alternative to Google Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s three reasons I wanted something different than Google Analytics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It adds load time to a website&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It uses cookies and requires a GDPR notice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It tracks users for Google’s own data gain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When rebuilding this site from scratch, one of my big focuses was on speed.&lt;/strong&gt; Since I was using Netlify to host and deploy my site from GitHub, I first tried their server-side analytics called &lt;a href=&quot;/netlify-analytics-review&quot;&gt;Netlify Analytics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netlify Analytics is cool because it tracks users on the server side vs the client side. That means it adds zero weight and load time to a website, doesn’t use cookies, and doesn’t track users. &lt;em&gt;Great!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the product isn’t nearly detailed enough to offer any actionable insights, especially at $9/month as I explained in my review:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;rec-img&quot;&gt;
                &lt;figure&gt;

                    &lt;/picture&gt;
                &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;        
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So still interested in other analytics platforms, I heard about Fathom through Twitter. Although it’s not server-side analytics, it is cookie-less and doesn’t add much more load time than Google Analytics does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of Fathom started in 2018 from a tweet by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pjrvs/&quot;&gt;Paul Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; who asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What if website analytics software didn’t take your users data to line their pockets for advertising?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paul Jarvis&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the idea behind this.&lt;/strong&gt; But a problem I couldn’t deal with when switching to Netlify Analytics was, as a marketer, not being able to take away enough actionable insights to improve my content and website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would Fathom Analytics be any different? &lt;strong&gt;Because I don’t want to pay for vanity metrics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is Fathom Analytics more expensive than Netlify Analytics, but it will add to my website’s load time. If I’m going to have to pay more and deal with the load time, it will have to be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So far, I’ve been using and paying for Fathom for seven months now and here’s what I think of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-review-of-fathom-analytics-can-it-replace-google-analytics-for-marketers&quot;&gt;My Review of Fathom Analytics: Can it Replace Google Analytics for Marketers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fathom analytics has two types of customers: personal blogs (like this website), and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For personal blogs, the message is simple: Google is kind of a bully and you don’t want to give them data on all your users. And their analytics is complicated to use. So here’s an analytics platform that just gives you the data you need and keeps your user data private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For businesses (and marketers), it’s a different story. We actually know how to use Google Analytics and rely on that data to help drive our SEO, content, and website strategy. &lt;strong&gt;Do most marketers care about their user privacy? Aren’t marketers the ones who are always trying to identify their users?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a much tougher sell. In my opinion, the only companies who are going to ditch Google Analytics for privacy-focused analytics like Fathom are ones with founders who already value data privacy. If they don’t, no chance in hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don’t think Paul Jarvis or his co-founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jackellis/&quot;&gt;Jack Ellis&lt;/a&gt; care. They don’t want those types of customers anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The way we run our business is ridiculously simple (not the norm in tech): we charge a fair amount of money for our product, use that money to keep the business running indefinitely, and remain small so that we don’t need a lot of money to be profitable and sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/about&quot;&gt;Fathom Analytics About Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you, as a marketer, don’t value data-privacy for your users, you’re probably not going to like Fathom Analytics. If you do, it’s then it’s the best privacy-focused analytics solution available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t decide whether you value data-privacy or tracking users more, then read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-data-can-you-see-from-fathom-analytics&quot;&gt;What Data Can You See from Fathom Analytics?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know what kind of data you can see in Fathom, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.usefathom.com/share/xcyerepi/regpaq&quot;&gt;check out my website’s analytics&lt;/a&gt;. With Fathom, you can choose to make your analytics public like I did, and you can see everything that I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of what you get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;live, real-time data that doesn’t expire like Netlify Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;custom date range picker to filter data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;total unique visits (equivalent to sessions in Google Analytics, I think), page views, average time on site, and bounce rate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list of your site’s URLs with the percent of total and number of unique visits and page views&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/support/goals&quot;&gt;unlimited goal creation&lt;/a&gt; by link click, page load, or form submission&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list of referrers (actual page referring URL) with the percent of total and number of unique visits and page views (also shows the individual tweets sending you traffic)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;device type, browser, and country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all sounds good, but when I dug in, I found some shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-want-from-fathom-analytics&quot;&gt;What I Want From Fathom Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a few things I’d like to see built in future releases. I’m not sure if it’s possible based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/news/anonymization&quot;&gt;their way of measuring traffic&lt;/a&gt;, but if it is, I would be so happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Fathom Analytics, you can’t:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;filter traffic by referrer to see what pages are being viewed by that referring traffic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or filter traffic by device type, browser, or country (no equivalent to Google Analytics’ dimensions)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;filter metrics by looking at a one page URL at a time to see the referrers, device type, country, and goals for any given page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;see bounce rate, average time spent on site, or goal completions by page URL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or see the above by the first page URL of a unique visit (equivalent to Google Analytics’ Landing Page dimension)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these were added, this would give me about 90% of what I use Google Analytics for as a marketer and would be sufficient for a personal blog, but still don’t think it could suffice for a growth-focused company’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they can’t add these features without sacrificing user privacy, Fathom is the type of company to stand its ground and say &lt;em&gt;no.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/usefathom/fathom/issues/283&quot;&gt;Paul Jarvis already denied my request to work with AMP.&lt;/a&gt; I get it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-cool-things-you-can-do-with-fathom-analytics&quot;&gt;Other Cool Things You Can Do With Fathom Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can choose to make your analytics public if you want to have a transparent website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://app.usefathom.com/share/xcyerepi/regpaq&quot;&gt;see my Fathom Analytics dashboard&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They do have an affiliate program where you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/ref/W2AU06&quot;&gt;get 25% lifetime commissions and people you refer will get $10 off their first month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They’re working on an API - I’m going to use it to display page view counts on articles for social proof&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can set up weekly and monthly reports and also set up client reports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can use it on unlimited domains and &lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/ref/W2AU06&quot;&gt;their pricing is based on total page views&lt;/a&gt; not by domain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/ref/W2AU06&quot;&gt;7-day free trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-fathom-analytics-worth-it&quot;&gt;Is Fathom Analytics Worth It?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fathom Analytics costs $14/month and right now, I do feel like I’m paying for vanity metrics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/fathom-analytics-pricing.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/fathom-analytics-pricing.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/fathom-analytics-pricing.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fathom Analytics starts at $14/month with unlimited domains.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Fathom Analytics starts at $14/month with unlimited domains.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I enjoy paying for it and using it on this site. It’s rare to come across a company that sticks to its mission which radiates in everything they do - their roadmap, design, content, and podcast. And they’re upfront about charging more than the industry standard so they can afford to stick to their principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I just love it when companies do that. And I’m a sucker for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So should you make the switch? Well it comes down to whether you can get behind the mission of the company:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Our goal is huge but simple: to make as many websites as possible black holes for data to Google.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;read-one-book-a-month&quot;&gt;Read one book a month&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like last year in 2018, I had a goal to read one book a month. Also like last year, I didn’t do it. In fact, &lt;em&gt;I did worse&lt;/em&gt;. Here’s what I did read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kindle (3): &lt;em&gt;The Effective Executive&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Laws of Human Nature&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Blitzscaling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audible (4): &lt;em&gt;Benjamin Franklin: An American Life&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The 50th Law&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Trust Me, I’m Lying&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Creative Calling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;rec-img&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;        
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only enjoyed &lt;em&gt;The Effective Executive&lt;/em&gt; so it’s the only book I published notes on. On the other hand, I enjoyed listening to all the audio books, especially Ryan Holiday’s &lt;em&gt;Trust Me, I’m Lying&lt;/em&gt; and Chase Jarvis’s &lt;em&gt;Creative Calling&lt;/em&gt;. Because it’s difficult to take notes on an audio book here’s my personal takeaway from each:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust Me, I’m Lying:&lt;/em&gt; The media can be unknowingly manipulated by marketers to create stories about what they want, and then the people are unknowingly manipulated to think and believe what marketers and the media want us to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creative Calling:&lt;/em&gt; Everyone has creativity and it makes us happy to use our creativity to make things. Strive to create more in your life and you will live a more satisfying life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I ended up spending a lot of time learning more HTML, CSS, and JS (more on this later), I didn’t read as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;write-one-article-a-week&quot;&gt;Write one article a week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t publish as much as I wanted to, but I did write more than last year. In total, I published eleven articles - a far cry from the goal of 52.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, I did do some of my best writing and started &lt;a href=&quot;/philosophy&quot;&gt;writing about philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my two favorite articles I wrote in 2019:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The articles I’m really proud of and enjoy writing are the ones that take the longest. With the time I allot to writing, it’s not sustainable to write these types of articles every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan for 2020 is to keep the same goal, but plan out my topics in advance and mix in shorter ones with longer ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last year I was considering quitting meditation and I did end up quitting it.&lt;/strong&gt; It was a drag to do in the mornings and I don’t really think it made enough of an impact in my day-to-day thoughts to warrant the will power it took to do every morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of meditating, I think I get more value from journaling. It’s not supposed to help in the same exact way, but &lt;strong&gt;journaling has helped me think more clearly and carefully about meaningful things in my life - goals, relationships, work, ideas, politics, and philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;. I did much better last year than in 2018 and I’m still going strong into 2020. Here’s a guide I wrote this year about journaling:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div class=&quot;rec-img&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;        
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disappointingly, I stopped going to the gym.&lt;/strong&gt; I was doing really well last year but then I tapered off. It all started from quitting Equinox, which saved me a lot of money. I tried to substitute it with my apartment’s gym, but the equipment is nowhere near expansive enough to continue my routine. I had to significantly adjust my exercises and they just weren’t as effective or enjoyable so I lost interest. I do plan to start again in 2020, but it’s not as high of a priority as it was in 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some good news is I didn’t miss a single day of flossing.&lt;/strong&gt; This may not seem like much to some, but it’s a big deal for me because I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; used to floss. And doing it every single day now? That’s a big change. It’s great to go to the dentist and not have to have the “flossing talk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I started tracking some new habits: learning how to code, reading, writing, and and staying on top of my finances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m setting a goal for 2020 to code at least a little bit every day,&lt;/strong&gt; whether it’s actually writing code or doing tutorials. I just want to make sure it stays fresh and relevant in my mind each day. The end goal is to build a few of my own web apps. I plan to write more about coding, and specifically the build process of this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A big priority for me in 2020 is to stay on top of my personal finances and how I’m spending my money.&lt;/strong&gt; Since I no longer have to stress about paying rent or my credit card bill (and I’m grateful for that), it’s led me to be much more careless about how I’m spending my money. I want to be more conscious of how I’m spending and I want to save more aggressively. Here’s the spreadsheet I’m using to manage my budget and a guide on how to use it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Other Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fired-from-chili-piper&quot;&gt;Fired from Chili Piper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As excited as I was to join the Chili Piper team, it had an abrupt ending last year. After eight months, the CEO and Co-Founder let me go despite &lt;a href=&quot;/resume&quot;&gt;accomplishing a lot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I wanted to join Chili Piper in the first place was for the opportunity to work under &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilshour&quot;&gt;Emil Shour&lt;/a&gt;, a marketer I respect and wanted to learn from. Only a few months after I joined, he decided to leave for another company. That left me to take over all of marketing and report directly to the CEO. At the time, it was a welcomed change to take on more responsibility, but it’s where things went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founder had a strong take on what good marketing is and it’s very different than what I believe it to be. &lt;strong&gt;He had a specific vision for what the company’s brand should be, which I believe reflected more the desires of a pet project than something our customers could best connect with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, however, it was my job to scale the brand around the founder’s vision. But because of our different marketing philosophies, we butted heads in just about every strategic discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In short, I failed to be the brand advocate the company needed. I failed to persuasively make my case for a better way. I failed to admit I took on more responsibility that I could handle. I failed to keep my head down and my foot on the gas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an important learning experience for my career and it had some great moments I’ll cherish. Lingering bitterness aside, I sincerely wish the founder, the team, and the company the best of luck and success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-a-better-idea-of-what-i-want-out-of-work&quot;&gt;Getting a better idea of what I want out of work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After suddenly exiting Chili Piper and the job I had before at ServiceTitan, I took a pause to think how my career was going. I used to be obsessed with my career and not in a &lt;em&gt;positive obsessed&lt;/em&gt; kind of way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At ServiceTitan, I tried to analyze the political power structure of the office so I could cozy up to the right people who had influence. I craved recognition and would resent the people who got it. I was fixated on the next promotion, becoming a manager, and how much money I made &lt;a href=&quot;/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others&quot;&gt;compared to my coworkers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I convinced myself I was better than them because I thought about work to this level, but it inevitably led to misery. To losing a game I had made up in my head.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is hard to write.&lt;/em&gt; It’s shocking I was like this and unaware of it at the time. I cringe when I imagine what my coworkers who saw through the charade thought of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But sometimes we need to get knocked out before we can be reborn.&lt;/strong&gt; The first punch was ServiceTitan’s CEO suggesting I move on to another company. The knockout blow was getting fired from Chili Piper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before applying to jobs, I took two months off to reflect on my behavior, what I did wrong, and what I’ll do differently next time. I thought about what I wanted out of life and how my career is not my everything, but just a piece of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I thought about all my previous coworkers. How much more I could have done to help them succeed.&lt;/strong&gt; How I seethed with resentment when they got praise instead of genuinely being happy for them when they completely deserved it. How I spent more of my time in envy, than being grateful for the opportunity I had and doing the actual good work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m still navigating through my redemption arc, but I’m already in a more tranquil state, trying to remember I’m in a good place instead of always wishing for the next thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quote has been on the background of my phone for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keeping-busy-in-my-time-off&quot;&gt;Keeping busy in my time off&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my break from work, I spent a lot of time brushing up on my HTML, CSS, and JS skills as a creative outlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I moved my blog off Medium to a static site&lt;/strong&gt; - essentially just hardcoded HTML and CSS files. I originally moved my blog from WordPress to Medium because I wanted to force myself to stop fiddling with the design. Now I went full on custom. &lt;em&gt;Hey, I had the time!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;        
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been taking &lt;a href=&quot;http://referrals.trhou.se/reggiepaquette&quot;&gt;online web development courses from Treehouse&lt;/a&gt; and completed their front end web development track. For 2020, I’m going to tackle their full stack javascript track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I “completed” a somewhat broken to-do app&lt;/strong&gt; that I started making two years ago. It works good enough for me to move on to the next project, but it’s special to me because it marks the completion of my first JS project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/2019-year-review-to-do.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/2019-year-review-to-do.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/images/2019-year-review-to-do.png&quot; alt=&quot;A simple to-do app using Google’s Inbox design&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/regpaq/todo-material&quot;&gt;A simple to-do app using Google’s Inbox design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;a href=&quot;/resume&quot;&gt;wrote several case studies of work I’ve done&lt;/a&gt; at ServiceTitan and Chili Piper to build a portfolio. I’m not sure how effective it was at helping me land an interview or secure an offer, but it helped me get me some confidence back by remembering the good work I’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-job&quot;&gt;New job&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I had to start applying to jobs (because money). I had a better idea in mind of the type of company I wanted to work for and the people I wanted to work with so I took my time and was selective with the companies I applied to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://revealbot.com/&quot;&gt;Revealbot&lt;/a&gt; on the remote job board &lt;a href=&quot;https://weworkremotely.com/&quot;&gt;WeWorkRemotely&lt;/a&gt; that stuck out to me for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They’re a B2B SaaS company offering a product for Facebook advertisers, a type of customer I know well because I spent around &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/resume&quot;&gt;$1.2MM in Facebook ads at ServiceTitan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Their website and product has a fantastic design which means the company values good design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I applied and did a preliminary project for them. &lt;strong&gt;I used part of my interviews with the co-founders to ask about their approach and philosophy to marketing and business, their values, and vision for the company to make sure it aligned with how I see things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned they have a full-time designer in house and that’s how they’re able to make every design detail on the website and app consistent, look fantastic, and provide a good user experience. &lt;strong&gt;As a marketer, a good designer makes everything I do look 10x better, so this was a huge plus to have one in house.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part was the feedback I got from the project I did for them. They were impressed with how much I did in the time I had and the direction of my approach and strategy. &lt;strong&gt;For me, this solidified this was the right place for me, so I accepted their offer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s now been 5 months and so far I’m really enjoying it. Recently, I was able to meet the team for the first time in person in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;barcelona&quot;&gt;Barcelona&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new work held their annual retreat in Barcelona and I got to go. This marks my second year in a row going to Europe and I hope to go again in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A group of us went to Camp Nou&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made this trip special was my girlfriend got to meet me there after spending a week with my coworkers.&lt;/strong&gt; It was her first time ever in Europe and we got to spend ten days in Barcelona together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my second time going to Barcelona, but this was definitely my favorite time. &lt;strong&gt;The food was spectacular, but most of all, I’ll miss the beautiful architecture in the Gothic Quarter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;utah&quot;&gt;Utah&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My entire family has now moved to Utah, including my parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year was the first time I went to visit them there. &lt;strong&gt;And as I get older, I recognize how important the relationships we have with family are, so it was great to spend a lot of time together and I’m planning to go again in 2020.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;san-francisco&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Christmas, I went to visit my girlfriend’s family in the bay area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We went into the city one night for dinner in China town. It was my first time in San Francisco.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cousin got married this year and he invited me on a weekend trip to Mexico for his bachelor’s party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in an Airbnb on the beach in Rosarito.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t get to see or talk with him often, so it was a great opportunity to spend time with him and catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I couldn’t end my yearly review without an update to my car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in my life, I bought my own set of aftermarket wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-for-2020&quot;&gt;Goals for 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have thought about this more, but here are the main things I want to achieve in 2020:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;read one book a month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;publish one article a week&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;complete the full stack javascript course from treehouse&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create a new blog for all my marketing content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;build my first complete web app people can reliably use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi’s goal is to make personal finance exciting and rewarding, a stark contrast from the dry, guilt-inducing material you typically would associate to the personal finance space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He won’t blame you for spending lots of money on the things you enjoy; the same things most people would tell you is irresponsible to spend so much money on. Instead he encourages you to keep doing it unapologetically.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catch? Cut spending harder in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Spend extravagantly on the things you love, and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His refreshing approach to money comes from the idea that money shouldn’t rule our lives, and instead be a tool to help us enjoy life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, he’ll encourage financial responsibility. Yes, he’ll advocate &lt;a href=&quot;/google-sheets-budget-template&quot;&gt;using a budget&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, he’ll try to persuade you to start saving for retirement immediately. &lt;strong&gt;But what makes Ramit different is he shows you how to get this important stuff done and out of the way by automating it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes room to think about the fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why do you want to be rich?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does being rich mean to you?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What do you love to spend money on?&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;how to invest intelligently with little work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to briefly cover his main recommendations from each topic, but because of his innovative approach to spending and budgeting and how practical it is, I’m going to spend a bit more time covering them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-make-credit-cards-work-for-you&quot;&gt;How to Make Credit Cards Work for You&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section covers a lot about what a credit score is, how it’s calculated, and how credit cards work - all great for beginners. These are the notes I took for myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;always use a credit card over a debit card - builds credit, protects your bank account, accrue rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;always pay off credit cards in full each month - treat it like a debit card&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set up automatic payments so you never miss a payment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;keep old credit cards active by charging a small monthly cost to keep credit history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;switch credit cards to a no annual fee card when it’s no longer your primary card&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;request credit limit increases to improve your credit utilization rate (a factor of your credit score)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be aware of and use your rewards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can negotiate lower APRs and get late fees waived if you call and ask&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section ends with strategies to pay off credit card debt. It can be summarized by paying off debt with the highest intrest rate, but it’s more nuanced than that. If you do have credit card debt, this section is worth reading in full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-set-up-the-right-bank-accounts&quot;&gt;How to Set Up The Right Bank Accounts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m always surprised when I learn friends use traditional big banks for their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They typically have the worse benefits, have minimum balance requirements for checking accounts, and a poor online banking experience. Ramit does a good job exposing these pitfalls by explaining how banks make money and the tactics they use to lure you in and make it hard to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a couple, but important takeaways on banks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;switch to an online bank (I recommend Capital One)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open a high-yield savings accounts (Capital One has them for free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-set-up-the-right-retirement-accounts&quot;&gt;How to Set Up The Right Retirement Accounts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the most important section so far, Ramit makes it simple to understand all the different types of retirement accounts and persuasively lays out why it’s so important to start saving for retirement now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He created five systematic steps for investing he calls “The Ladder of Personal Finance.”&lt;/strong&gt; When you finish the first step, or if it’s not an option, you proceed to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;contribute 100% of what your employer matches in a company 401k&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pay off credit card or other debt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open a Roth IRA and contribute up to the annual maximum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;max out your 401k beyond or regardless of a company match&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;put the rest in a non retirement brokerage account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this section goes deep into each step of the ladder, explaining everything very clearly. I was finally able to understand the tax advantages of each different kind of retirement account and also why it was valuable to start now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-manage-spending-and-enjoy-it&quot;&gt;How to Manage Spending and Enjoy It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you can learn to how to better manage your money he says you need to understand where you’re spending it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, he doesn’t recommend creating a budget where you track your finances down to the penny, but instead do what he calls a “Conscious Spending Plan,” which still sounds an awful lot like a budget, just a little more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conscious Spending is Ramit’s method of allowing yourself to spend money on the things that bring you joy, even if they seem frivolous to other people, or even frivolous to you. In exchange, you cut the spending elsewhere. This is how Ramit defines frugality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Frugality isn’t about cutting your spending on everything. That approach wouldn’t last two days. Frugality, quite simply, is about choosing the things you love enough to spend extravagantly on - and then cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t love.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-make-a-conscious-spending-plan&quot;&gt;How to make a conscious spending plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divide up where your take home pay goes into four major buckets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Money Buckets&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Percent of take home pay to allocate&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I. Fixed Costs - Rent, utilities, debt, etc.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;50-60%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;II. Investments - 401(k), Rotha IRA&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;III. Savings - Vacations, gifts, house down payment, unexpected expenses&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5-10%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;IV. Guilt-free spending money - Dining out, drinking, movies, clothes, shoes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;20-35%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed costs are expenses you have to pay every month no matter what. Once you total them up, subtract that amount from your take-home pay.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out how much you want to save for retirement in a 401k and or IRA and then deduct that amount.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think about what you want to save for in the short and long term. Calculate how much you need to save per month to reach that goal and then deduct that amount.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After allocating money for fixed costs, retirement and investments, and savings, the rest is for guilt-free spending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/google-sheets-budget-template&quot;&gt;I made a budget template on Google Sheets&lt;/a&gt; based on Ramit’s Conscious Spending Plan that can you help do all this.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tips-to-optimize-your-conscious-spending-plan&quot;&gt;Tips to optimize your Conscious Spending Plan:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;always try to cut fixed costs and guilt-free spending before cutting how much you allocate to investing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;focus on big wins to cut spending, not small ones like buying generic brands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you’re more likely to stick to a new budget by making a gradual change than a dramatic one&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;actually write out tangible savings goals to increase motivation to achieve them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-the-envelope-system-to-target-big-wins&quot;&gt;Use the “envelope system” to target big wins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The envelope system is essentially a second bucket system for your guilt-free spending. You allocate a certain amount of your guilt-free spending to certain categories (envelopes) and once you spend all the money in that envelope, that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s much easier to figure out how much money you should put into each envelope by looking at your last three months of spending in each category, averaging them out, and then setting an achievable goal for each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a good objective to try and meet your spending goal for each category, but you can dip into other envelopes if you need to. The most important thing is keeping your total spending below what you have for guilt-free spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;activity-based-envelopes&quot;&gt;Activity based envelopes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One trick Ramit mentions that I’ve used in the past is instead of using the general categories that credit card companies and banks typically use, create categories more personal to you and &lt;em&gt;around events&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I have used these categories in the past:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;eating out alone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coffee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;alcohol for home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;going out with friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this requires a manual categorization of each expense, it will highglight the driving activities behind your spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to keep track of spending is to always use a credit card (as long as your responsible) so you can just pull up your account to enter expenses into your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The best part about setting up a strategic budget is that it guides your decisions, letting you say no much more easily - ‘Sorry, it’s not in my plan this month.’ - and freeing you up to enjoy what you do spend on. This is guilt-free spending at its best.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-automate-it-all-to-be-hands-off&quot;&gt;How to Automate It All to be Hands Off&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re contributing to a 401k, that’s probably already automated by your employer before even receiving your paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then your paycheck gets deposited into your checking account and from there you set up a monthly automatic transfer to your other retirement and savings accounts. &lt;strong&gt;By transferring the money automatically right after you get paid, you’re paying yourself first, not spending first and saving what’s left over.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s why the money left over to spend is guilt-free spending money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the flow looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;How to automate your finances. Automatically transfer to savings first. Your percentage allocation may differ.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“By setting up an automatic payment plan you actually make it difficult to stop the contributions to your retirement account! Not because you can’t - you can adjust your system any time - but because you’re lazy and you won’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More automation tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set up all bills to be paid by credit card automatically&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if a bill (like rent) can’t be paid by card, set up auto bill pay to have your bank automtically send a check on your behalf&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set up your credit card bill to be paid automatically from your checking account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set a reminder in the middle of the month to check how you much you’ve spent compared to what you’ve allocated for guilt-free spending&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-invest-intelligently-with-little-work&quot;&gt;How to Invest Intelligently with Little Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section of &lt;em&gt;I Will Teach You to be Rich&lt;/em&gt;, Ramit walks us through how to invest the money in your 401ks and IRAs. It’s a good introduction to the foundational topics of investing that can be summed up in a few points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be less risk averse when you’re younger, more risk averse when older&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hardly anyone beats the market, even full-time investors so it’s not worth trying to pick the right stocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t invest in any funds with high fees, like mutual funds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it’s better long term to invest in low-fee index funds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some diversification is good, just remember to rebalance your ratios annually&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;invest in lifecycle funds to be completely hands off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramit goes into more details on each one of these here and explains why he gives the advice he does. It’s solid financial advice and worth reading more into if you’re fresh to personal finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-personal-finance-tips&quot;&gt;Final Personal Finance Tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;try and invest as much as you can, as early as you can&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if your income increases, look to increase how much you allocate to savings first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ignore the noise of the financial industry, it can cause you to get emotional and make bad decisions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t worry about tricks to avoid taxes or seeing a financial advisor until your investments total $100k+&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;create an emergency fund to protect against job loss or unexpected, expensive bills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Unlike other people, who worry about money (because they never learned how it works), you get to focus on the things you love.”&lt;/p&gt;

It seems we make our own choices. It seems we choose our beliefs. It seems we can think about what we want, when we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems everything we do is of our own free will and this all seems quite obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there does exist the opposite belief that we don’t have free will to choose all those things ourselves and rather our thoughts, beliefs, choices, and actions are determined only by a result of previous causes that could not have resulted in any other outcome. &lt;strong&gt;This philosophical belief is called determinism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned about determinism from Sam Harris and my first reaction was &lt;em&gt;no way that’s even close to being right, of course we have free will&lt;/em&gt;. But after listening to his arguments and doing my own research on determinism, I can’t help but be convinced it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This realization had such a profound effect on me it has fundamentally changed the way I think about myself, other people, and the world around me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is an examination into determinism versus free will, thought exercises to illustrate the lack of free will in our thoughts, beliefs, choices, and actions, and finally the implications of it in our daily lives and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;free-will-vs-determinism&quot;&gt;Free Will vs Determinism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism#History&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Determinism&lt;/a&gt; is the philosophical belief that any thought you have, belief you uphold, choice you make, and action you take is determined by a chain of previous causes that could not be otherwise because of those causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Free will&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, is the belief we have the unimpeded ability to control our thoughts, choose our beliefs, make choices, and take actions between different possible options. &lt;strong&gt;The key question that differentiates determinism and free will is &lt;em&gt;are you capable to have done otherwise?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Harris did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/w8Q6CWv7IXo?t=8106&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;great thought exercise on the Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate the difference. It goes like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of a city - any city in the world. &lt;em&gt;Now say it out loud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could have chosen any of the hundreds of cities you know the name of, &lt;em&gt;but you chose that one.&lt;/em&gt; Some other cities might have run through your head right before you answered, but there were hundreds that didn’t even occur to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the hundreds of possible options, this seems like an example of one of the freest choices you can make. But if we go back in time right to the moment where I first asked you to say the city out loud, &lt;em&gt;could you have chosen a different city?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you examine your thought process leading to your city of choice, you’ll find reasons that caused you to choose that city - fond memories, something you saw today, or simply how you were feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a universe with free will, you’d be capable of using those inputs to choose one city and you could have easily chosen a different city. But in a deterministic universe, we could go back 1,000 times right to the start of this thought exercise and you’d go through that same exact thought process and you’d choose that same city every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s the difference between free will and determinism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arguments-for-determinism&quot;&gt;Arguments for Determinism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are thought exercises to reveal how much of who we are, our thoughts, beliefs, choices, and actions are the product of causes rather than choices from our own free will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-didnt-choose-our-genetics-or-upbringing&quot;&gt;We didn’t choose our genetics or upbringing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, we’re alive. And it wasn’t by choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t get to choose the country or city we were born and raised in. We didn’t choose the culture. We didn’t choose the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t get to choose our genetic code, how tall we’d become, how attractive or unattractive we are, the sound of our voice, the color of our skin, the language we speak, our natural talents, our gender or sex, or the diseases we’re susceptible to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t get to choose our parents, how much or how little money they had to raise us with, their relationship between each other, the religion, values, and politics they ingrained in us, or how much or how little they pushed us in sports, music, or academics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How our parents raised us (or the people who did), heavily influence our identity, character, values, beliefs, and future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re a parent, you already know this is true or you wouldn’t have read all those books or watched all those videos on how to become a great parent. You wouldn’t have tried as hard as you did to create the best possible life for your children if you knew it wouldn’t make a difference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to think about your upbringing. How much has it made you who you are today? How much of that was your choice? How much of that was determined and out of your control?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-dont-choose-our-own-thoughts&quot;&gt;We don’t choose our own thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the part of us that feels closest to our sense of free will, our thoughts seem to be the element we have complete control of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we are in complete control of our thoughts, &lt;strong&gt;why do we struggle with staying focused and distractions? It’s not that we choose to be distracted. It happens “against our will” because we don’t have the control to choose what we think about.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’ve ever practiced meditation, you already know how frequently random thoughts surface themselves, completely outside of our control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not only do we not choose what and when we think about things, we don’t choose our opinion of things either. &lt;strong&gt;If we did have free will and complete control of choosing our opinions, marketing and advertising wouldn’t be a multi billion dollar industry fighting for our attention,&lt;/strong&gt; we wouldn’t be the average of the five people we surround ourselves with, &lt;a href=&quot;/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others&quot;&gt;social media wouldn’t affect our mental health&lt;/a&gt;, and good and bad influences wouldn’t make a difference to our character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the many things that influence every thought and opinion we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if we don’t choose the things we think about, when we think about them, and our opinions of them, how can we possibly ever have a thought or opinion formed purely from our choice alone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-dont-choose-our-own-beliefs&quot;&gt;We don’t choose our own beliefs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to think of a strong belief you have, such as a religious belief or political position. What is your best reason for believing your belief or position is right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever your best reason was, it wasn’t &lt;em&gt;because I chose to believe it,&lt;/em&gt; was it? &lt;strong&gt;That’s because we don’t choose our beliefs. We’re convinced of them. It’s only until we’re convinced of a belief that we can uphold that belief with conviction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate this is true, see if you’re capable of choosing to believe the opposite view of the belief or position you were just thinking of. Could you do it? If you believe the Earth is a sphere, can you choose to believe right now, with complete conviction, that it’s flat? The reason why you can’t is because you’ve already been presented with good reasons why it’s a sphere and good reasons why it’s not flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need good reasons to believe something, and making a choice to believe something is never a good enough reason for a strong belief to form.&lt;/strong&gt; So what is a good enough reason?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To our detriment, a good enough reason is anything that sounds more convincing to us than what we knew before and it’s here wherein lies the problem. We can be convinced to uphold false beliefs for objectively bad reasons. These bad, but convincing, reasons are often &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;logical fallacies&lt;/a&gt; strengthened through &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourbias.is/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cognitive biases&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s why some people do believe the Earth is flat with complete conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And consider for a moment why we even have the beliefs we do in the first place. Beliefs are pushed onto us from every angle since birth from our parents, teachers and textbooks, church and church leaders, community and culture, the news media, and on and on. &lt;strong&gt;Then we have social media that exacerbates the problem by isolating us into echo chambers that feed into our confirmation bias.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, because we don’t choose which beliefs are up for consideration in the first place and we can’t choose which to uphold, it’s clear our beliefs are determined, not chosen by our own free will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-dont-make-our-own-choices&quot;&gt;We don’t make our own choices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Harris’s ‘pick a city’ thought exercise is a demonstration of how we use previous causes to make a choice. Although this is an example of one of the freest choices you can make, it is an inconsequential choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely life’s more consequential choices where we spend weeks reflecting and deliberating over the pros and cons of that choice has to be an example of using free will to make a choice, right? Let’s explore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you’re deciding which college to go to for your bachelor’s degree. The pros and cons you might be deliberating over are the schools’ prestiges, quality of major programs, how much fun you’ll have, and where your parents want you to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your genetics, upbringing, thoughts, opinions, and beliefs will determine your final assessment for each of these considerations. &lt;strong&gt;These are the tools we use to make decisions and if our decision making tools are determined, then the choices we end up making from them are determined.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, neither the time it takes to make a choice or the level of consequence in a choice’s outcome changes the fact that our choices are determined. We’re still capable of making choices in a deterministic universe, but we are never capable of choosing something else than what we do end up choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-dont-control-our-own-actions&quot;&gt;We don’t control our own actions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actions can occur either unconsciously or consciously. Unconscious actions like scratching an itch, sighing, or bouncing your leg up and down while sitting are actions that occur, without a doubt, from a cause, not by choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conscious actions require a choice to act. And if choices are determined, then actions are determined.&lt;/strong&gt; We can even make a choice to act and still fail to complete that act because causes are more powerful than our choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means we don’t have complete control of our actions or body. If we did, we wouldn’t choose to &lt;a href=&quot;/how-to-break-bad-habits&quot;&gt;break a bad habit&lt;/a&gt; and fail. We wouldn’t choose to &lt;a href=&quot;/how-to-make-habits-stick&quot;&gt;start a good habit&lt;/a&gt; and fail. We wouldn’t need to read a &lt;a href=&quot;/atomic-habits-review-notes-lessons&quot;&gt;book on habits&lt;/a&gt; at all. If we had free will and control of our actions, we could simply choose to do something and do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we don’t have control of our actions because we don’t have control of our choices. We don’t have control of our choices because we don’t have control of our beliefs. We don’t have control of our beliefs because we don’t have control of our thoughts, opinions, genetics, or how we were raised.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-the-lack-of-free-will-matter&quot;&gt;Does the Lack of Free Will Matter?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determining whether we have free will or not matters because if we do have free will, that means we should have full, moral responsibility for our actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we don’t have free will, how much moral responsibility should we bear for actions we could not have done otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Admitting that free will is an illusion actually does have some important consequences. They’re not the kind of consequences that people worry about. It’s not that you have no basis to be a better person or to change your life or to make efforts to improve yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“That all remains intact, but it does change our ethical views of good and evil in some important ways.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sam Harris, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/w8Q6CWv7IXo?t=8319&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Joe Rogan Experience #543 2:18:39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, let’s look at what the lack of free will means for our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-be-too-hard-on-yourself&quot;&gt;Don’t be too hard on yourself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be disappointed with the way you look, how much money you make, or how many followers you have. You might &lt;a href=&quot;/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others&quot;&gt;compare yourself to others&lt;/a&gt; and be disappointed with how ordinary or inadequate you are compared to them. I’ve been there and I think we’ve all been there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By understanding that we don’t have control over the causes that determine our looks, income, popularity, or status, it becomes possible to accept who we are and be grateful for what we have.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/picture&gt;
                &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;        
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most empowering tenets of Stoicism and why I’ve fully embraced its philosophy into my life is about identifying and separating the things that are up to us from what’s not. If something is not up to us and is out of our control, then we shouldn’t get angry, scared, or grieve about it because there’s nothing we could have done to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When a slave runs away from his master, we call him a fugitive slave. But the law of nature is a master too, and to break it is to become a fugitive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“To feel grief, anger, or fear is to try to escape from something decreed by the ruler of all things, now or in the past or in the future. And that ruler is law [fate], which governs what happens to each of us. To feel grief or anger or fear is to become a fugitive — a fugitive from justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius,  &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 10.25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infusing determinism and Stoicism into my perspective has shown me that getting angry, sad, and frustrated with who and where I am today would be denying that my previous causes could not have been anything else than what they were.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, these negative emotions are unnecessary. All they do is bring extra harm for no rational reason. Identifying the things that are outside of my control has &lt;a href=&quot;/virtue-is-its-own-reward&quot;&gt;ultimately brought tranquility into my life.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-good-to-other-people&quot;&gt;Be good to other people&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just as you recognize the things you can’t control about yourself, it’s just as powerful to recognize other people are the way they are and do the things they do because of causes outside of their control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So think about that the next time your significant other, a family member, friend, or coworker does something you find weird or wrong. It doesn’t seem weird or wrong to them because of their previous causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to choose [how to react].”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius,  &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 7.22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have objectively good reasons for thinking whatever they’re doing is weird or wrong, they may just not know better and that’s okay. If you’re able to, try and steer them in the right direction. &lt;strong&gt;The worst thing you can do for your relationship and your own well-being, is pass blame.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If it’s in your control, why do you do it? If it’s in someone else’s, then who are you blaming? Atoms? The gods? Stupid either way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Blame no one. Set people straight, if you can. If not, just repair the damage. And suppose you can’t do that either. Then where does blaming people get you?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius,  &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 8.17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeing the universe, yourself, and other people through a lens of determinism and Stoicism adds a priceless attribute to your character: empathy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-more-aware-of-what-influences-you&quot;&gt;Be more aware of what influences you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally everything and everyone around us is influencing our thoughts, beliefs, and behavior in every moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pay attention to your thoughts and emotions throughout the day. Try to understand what made you think and feel that way.&lt;/em&gt; By being able to identify the cause, we can cut out the negative influences and increase the positive ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius often draws a comparison between being unaware of your influences to “being jerked like a puppet by our own impulses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s time you realized that you have something in you more powerful and miraculous than the things that affect you and make you dance like a puppet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“What’s in my thoughts at this moment? Fear? Jealousy? Desire? Feelings like that?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius,  &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 12.19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “power” he’s referring to is our ability to be aware of these influences and how we choose to react to them. This is a skill that takes practice. Meditation is the most popular method to get better at it, but I’ve found &lt;a href=&quot;/stoic-journal-topics&quot;&gt;daily journaling&lt;/a&gt; to work better for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly realized social media and video games were some of my biggest negative influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the expense of losing touch with some friends, I deleted Snapchat and Instagram because it made me &lt;a href=&quot;/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others&quot;&gt;care too much about what other people think of me&lt;/a&gt;, envy the lives other people live and the things they have, and lose gratitude for who I am and what I have in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sold my Playstation because all I wanted to do was game when I got off work. I realized it was an unproductive use of time and losing online games would leave me annoyed and frustrated (FIFA players understand).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-on-politics-and-society&quot;&gt;Impact on politics and society&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perspective of empathy through determinism and Stoicism can be extended to people who live on the opposite side of the globe, who we don’t understand, and who society deems bad. Through practicing this perspective, it’s possible to develop empathy for these people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, people in jail for committing crimes have previous causes that led them to do so, whether those crimes are theft, drug related, or assault. While determinism doesn’t mean our society must rid all fault and responsibility from those who commit crimes, but maybe we should emphasize an approach of rehabilitation more than punishment in our criminal justice system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should be more empathetic to people who were born in a third world country through no choice of their own. Maybe we should be more empathetic to people who have different religious beliefs and political positions due to causes outside of their control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some critics say there isn’t much of a practical difference between free will and the illusion of it, there are clear implications to the understanding of ourselves, other people, and the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge yourself to be aware of the influences on your thoughts, beliefs, and behavior. Challenge yourself to accept and be grateful for who you are, what you have, and what you’ve accomplished. Challenge yourself to feel affection for other people even when they make mistakes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Reggie Paquette</name></author><category term="[&quot;all&quot;]" /><summary type="html">It seems we have control of our actions.

&lt;p&gt;Or in other words, build the biggest legacy. &lt;strong&gt;And if my life ended without a legacy, if there wasn’t a large subset of people who remembered me or knew who I was even just 50 years after I died, my life was… well meaningless.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a demoralizing point-of-view, but I couldn’t reason or justify a better measurement for meaning. I’d rather accept a harsh reality as true than keep my head in the sand and believe a false reality to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I was conflicted when reading how strong &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Marcus Aurelius&lt;/a&gt; and the Stoics believed accepting fate and doing good as the highest objective he strived to achieve in life. This is one of my favorite Aurelius quotes about this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be good. Like gold or emerald or purple repeating to itself, “No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be emerald, my color undiminished.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 7.15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this quote because he says his task is to be good, like an emerald’s task is to be emerald in color. An emerald can’t be anything but emerald. And Aurelius strives to be good to his core so he couldn’t do anything but good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I didn’t understand how striving to achieve virtue could lead to a meaningful life. But then I understood Aurelius didn’t seek to achieve meaning. &lt;strong&gt;Rather, he sought to achieve goodness.&lt;/strong&gt; So what did Aurelius know about meaning to disregard it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;according-to-marcus-aurelius-life-and-legacy-are-trivial-and-meaningless&quot;&gt;According to Marcus Aurelius, Life and Legacy are Trivial and Meaningless&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s my understanding that Aurelius never believed in a “meaningful” life. In one meditation, he equated the entirety of life to a rock being thrown in the air and coming back down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A rock thrown in the air. It loses nothing by coming down, gained nothing by going up.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 9.17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another, he wrote about exercising awareness in the moment, not to appreciate it, but to realize it’s not much to miss out on when he dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Stop whatever you’re doing for a moment and ask yourself: Am I afraid of death because I won’t be able to do this anymore?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 10.29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the impression Aurelius believed life was something that had to be done and put up with as fate demanded. Why? Because death scared him and he wanted to believe he wouldn’t be missing out on anything when he died to better cope with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Human lives are brief and trivial. Yesterday a blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid, ash.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it up without complaint.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 4.48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-aurelius-had-to-say-about-legacy-and-fame&quot;&gt;What Aurelius had to say about legacy and fame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacies are born out of fame and Aurelius had a disdain for it for two reasons. If you’re working towards achieving fame, it means you care too much about what other people think of you. And second, fame doesn’t last long so it’s pointless to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…look at how soon we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us - how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space…”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 4.3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter if people remember you 50 years after death or 200, you will still be forgotten. Think about how many people you know of the names of who were alive 200 years ago in 1819. There was a billion people alive in the world then. Can you name more than five?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“So many who were remembered already forgotten, and those who remembered them long gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-criticisms-of-marcus-aureliuss-point-of-view&quot;&gt;My Criticisms of Marcus Aurelius’s Point-of-View&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on my interpretation of Aurelius’s beliefs, legacy, fame, and being remembered is meaningless. And life itself is void of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only criticism is you can take two people, and objectively determine which had more impact, and thus more meaning. For example, taken to the extreme, it’s easy to identify who had more impact and meant more to society: Steve Jobs vs the average joe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to point out that impact could be positive or negative. For example, Martin Luther King Jr vs Osama Bin Laden. Both had great impact on society, but in opposite directions. If, for sake of argument, we quantified their impact as equal would their meaning be equal? Does meaning take into account positive vs negative impact? I think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius and the Stoics believed being virtuous and doing good as the highest objective. &lt;strong&gt;Then, according to Stoicism, wouldn’t someone who does more good than another have both more impact and more meaning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stoics argued that the only thing in our control is our mind. And it’s rare for people to make an impact at the level of Jobs or MLK. If all it took to make a high impact was desire and tenacity, there would be a lot more people making that high of an impact. But there are lot of factors outside of our control, which makes the highest level of achievement impossible for most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, while there may be objective measures to determine if a life is more impactful or meaningful than another, it’s fruitless to pursue it and make it your highest objective. Instead, the Stoics argue it’s best to make virtue and doing good the highest objective, which is entirely within our control. I’m beginning to understand why.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-how-virtue-is-its-own-reward&quot;&gt;Understanding How Virtue is Its Own Reward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailystoic.com/4-stoic-virtues/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ryan Holiday puts it&lt;/a&gt;, “A Stoic believes they don’t control the world around them, only how they respond — and that they must always respond with courage, temperance, wisdom, and justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the four core virtues of Stoicism. Aurelius believed &lt;strong&gt;justice&lt;/strong&gt; was the most important, because acting with justice is doing good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“And a commitment to justice in your own acts. Which means: thought and action resulting in the common good. What you were born to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 9.31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completed &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations&lt;/a&gt; for the first time two years ago. Since then, I’ve been adopting a Stoic mindset and I’ve seen myself undergo a dramatic transformation. Acting with justice and virtue has given me a new level of patience and resilience, improved my relationships, and fostered an affection for all people. It has redirected my ambition from building a legacy and longing for recognition to a mission of doing good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing out how acting with justice has helped me in all these ways, but I can’t explain it better than Marcus Aurelius himself. Here are some of my favorite meditations on doing good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to choose.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 7.22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you’ll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger. Your sense of good and evil may be the same as theirs, or near it, in which case you have to excuse them. Or your sense of good and evil may differ from theirs. In which case they’re misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 7.26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To do harm is to do yourself harm. To do an injustice is to do yourself an injustice - it degrades you.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 9.4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When faced with people’s bad behavior, turn around ask when &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; have acted like that. When you saw money as good, or pleasure, or social position. Your anger will subside as soon as you recognize that they acted under compulsion (what else could they do?)…”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 10.30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“That you don’t know for sure it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a mistake. A lot of things are means to some other end. You have to know an awful lot before you can judge other people’s actions with real understanding.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 11.18.v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you believe doing good as the highest objective, you feel good when you do it. &lt;strong&gt;Acting with justice and virtue is its own reward because acting virtuously is synonymous with doing good to others and preserving your integrity. With self fulfillment and happiness as a bonus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What is the goal of virtue, after all, except a life that flows smoothly?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Epictetus, Book I, 108&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave you with one last meditation that sums up Aurelius’s and the Stoics point-of-view and reason for doing good as the highest objective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…And how does it injure you anyway? You’ll find that none of the people you’re upset about has done anything that could do damage to your mind. But that’s all that “harm” or “injury” could mean. Yes, boorish people do boorish things. What’s strange or unheard of about that? Isn’t it yourself you should reproach - for not anticipating that they’d act this way? The logos gave you the means to see it - that a person would act a given way - but you paid no attention. And now you’re astonished that he’s gone and done it. So when you call someone “untrustworthy” or “ungrateful,” turn the reproach on yourself. It was you who did wrong. By assuming that someone with those traits deserved your trust. Or by doing them a favor and expecting something in return, instead of looking to the action itself for your reward. What else did you expect from helping someone out? Isn’t it enough that you’ve done what your nature demands? You want a salary for it, too? As if your eyes expected a reward for seeing, or your feet for walking. That’s what they were made for. By doing what they were designed to do, they’re performing their function. Whereas humans were made to help others. And when we do help others - or help them to do something - we’re doing what we were designed for. We perform our function.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask “what needs to be done?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask “what is right for the company?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop action plans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take responsibility for decisions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take responsibility for communicating&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on opportunities rather than problems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run productive meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think and say “we” rather than “I”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two give you the knowledge you need. The next four convert that knowledge into effective action. The last two gets your team to feel responsible and inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Effective Executive, Drucker explains what an effective executive is and how to become one. He believed being an effective executive could be learned and this book served as a handbook to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Executives are doers; they execute. Knowledge is useless to executives until it has been translated into deeds. But before springing into action, the executive needs to plan his course. He needs to think about desired results, probable restraints, future revisions, check-in points, and implications for how he’ll spend his time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-makes-an-executive-effective&quot;&gt;What Makes an Executive Effective?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking “what do I want to do?” ask “what has to be done?” This is crucial for managerial success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The answer to this question “…almost always contains more than one urgent task. But effective executives do not splinter themselves. They concentrate on one task if at all possible. […] I have never encountered an executive who remains effective while tackling more than two tasks at a time. Hence, after asking what needs to be done, the effective executive sets priorities and sticks to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have the top initiatives prioritized, you need to choose which you are especially good at undertaking and then delegate the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives try to focus on jobs they’ll do especially well. They know that enterprises perform if top management performs—and don’t if it doesn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-is-the-beginning-of-your-action-plan&quot;&gt;This is the beginning of your action plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your action plan is a prioritized list of initiatives and tasks for you and your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The action plan is a statement of intentions rather than a commitment. It must not become a straitjacket. It should be revised often, because every success creates new opportunities. So does every failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Develop the plan in a tool that makes it easy to check-in, provide updates, and move items around as it progresses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Napoleon allegedly said that no successful battle ever followed its plan. Yet Napoleon also planned every one of his battles, far more meticulously than any earlier general had done. Without an action plan, the executive becomes a prisoner of events. And without check-ins to reexamine the plan as events unfold, the executive has no way of knowing which events really matter and which are only noise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And an action plan is useless unless it’s communicated and understood by your teams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decision has not really been made until people know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who is accountable for delivering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the deadline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who and which teams are affected by the decision and therefore have to understand and approve it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who else should be informed of the decision, even if not directly affected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action plan shouldn’t be given as an order from the top. Get and incorporate feedback. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives make sure that both their action plans and their information needs are understood. Specifically, this means that they share their plans with and ask for comments from all their colleagues—superiors, subordinates, and peers. At the same time, they let each person know what information they’ll need to get the job done. The information flow from subordinate to boss is usually what gets the most attention. But executives need to pay equal attention to peers’ and superiors’ information needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although problems stick out like a nail begging to be hammered, don’t make fixing a problem a top priority.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Good executives focus on opportunities rather than problems. Problems have to be taken care of, of course; they must not be swept under the rug. But problem solving, however necessary, does not produce results. It prevents damage. Exploiting opportunities produces results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when delegating tasks…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives put their best people on opportunities rather than on problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Drucker recalls how an effective executive would run a meeting, he thinks back on an old colleague of his.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“At the beginning of a formal meeting, Sloan announced the meeting’s purpose. He then listened. He never took notes and he rarely spoke except to clarify a confusing point. At the end he summed up, thanked the participants, and left. Then he immediately wrote a short memo addressed to one attendee of the meeting. In that note, he summarized the discussion and its conclusions and spelled out any work assignment decided upon in the meeting (including a decision to hold another meeting on the subject or to study an issue). He specified the deadline and the executive who was to be accountable for the assignment. He sent a copy of the memo to everyone who’d been present at the meeting. It was through these memos—each a small masterpiece—that Sloan made himself into an outstandingly effective executive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;effectiveness-can-be-learned&quot;&gt;Effectiveness Can Be Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing to come up with a good idea. It’s another thing all together to execute that idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself achievement. […] Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;effective-executive-are-masters-of-their-time&quot;&gt;Effective Executive Are Masters of Their Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the most out of your time and your team’s time is an essential first step to becoming effecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[Effective executives] start with their time. And they do not start out with planning. They start by finding out where their time actually goes. Then they attempt to manage their time and to cut back unproductive demands on their time. Finally they consolidate their “discretionary” time into the largest possible continuing units.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To master your time, follow this three step process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;record your time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;manage your time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;consolidate your time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The first step toward executive effectiveness is therefore to record actual time-use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tips-on-recording-time&quot;&gt;Tips on Recording Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measure it in real-time, not later from memory&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recording time is a habit that can improve with constant effort&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out how to make time management systematic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve been recording your time, you can analyze it and see what the time wasters are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To find these time-wastes, one asks of all activities in the time records: ‘What would happen if this were not done at all?’ And if the answer is, ‘Nothing would happen,’ then obviously the conclusion is to stop doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then determine which of the activities left can be delegated to some else. Now you can see how much time you have for important tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The executive who records and analyzes his time and then attempts to manage it can determine how much he has for his important tasks. How much time is there that is “discretionary,” that is, available for the big tasks that will really make a contribution? It is not going to be a great deal, no matter how ruthlessly the executive prunes time-wasters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drucker discovered that it’s much more effective to block open time in as large of chunks as possible to get into deep work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The effective executive therefore knows that he has to consolidate his [open] time. He knows that he needs large chunks of time and that small driblets are no time at all. Even one quarter of the working day, if consolidated in large time units, is usually enough to get the important things done. But even three quarters of the working day are useless if they are only available as fifteen minutes here or half an hour there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Time is the scarcest resource, and unless it is managed, nothing else can be managed. The analysis of one’s time, moreover, is the one easily accessible and yet systematic way to analyze one’s work and to think through what really matters in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executives-are-also-responsible-for-their-teams-time&quot;&gt;Executives are Also Responsible for Their Team’s Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common time waste is when the executive wastes his individual team members’ time. To overcome this, Drucker advises executives to directly as their team if and how he/she wastes their time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives have learned to ask systematically and without coyness: “What do I do that wastes your time without contributing to your effectiveness?” To ask this question, and to ask it without being afraid of the truth, is a mark of the effective executive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tips-on-managing-meetings&quot;&gt;Tips on Managing Meetings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like to be “in the know” and aware of what’s going on. Effective executives should let the whole team know when a meeting will take place and on what topic. Make it optional for people to join so they don’t feel left out. In any case, summarize the meeting notes, send to the team, and allow for questions and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Meetings are by definition a concession to deficient organization for one either meets or one works. One cannot do both at the same time. In an ideally designed structure (which in a changing world is of course only a dream) there would be no meetings. Everybody would know what he needs to know to do his job. Everyone would have the resources available to him to do his job. We meet because people holding different jobs have to cooperate to get a specific task done. We meet because the knowledge and experience needed in a specific situation are not available in one head, but have to be pieced together out of the experience and knowledge of several people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to run meetings effectively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The effective man always states at the outset of a meeting the specific purpose and contribution it is to achieve. He makes sure that the meeting addresses itself to this purpose. He does not allow a meeting called to inform to degenerate into a “bull session” in which everyone has bright ideas. But a meeting called by him to stimulate thinking and ideas also does not become simply a presentation on the part of one of the members, but is run to challenge and stimulate everybody in the room. He always, at the end of his meetings, goes back to the opening statement and relates the final conclusions to the original intent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-effective-executive-focuses-on-contribution&quot;&gt;The Effective Executive Focuses on Contribution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective executive are always focusing on contribution that makes a positive impact on the company’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The man who focuses on efforts and who stresses his downward authority is a subordinate no matter how exalted his title and rank. But the man who focuses on contribution and who takes responsibility for results, no matter how junior, is in the most literal sense of the phrase, “top management.” He holds himself accountable for the performance of the whole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to achieve that, you can’t only look inward to what you want to do and what you think you can do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The focus on contribution turns the executive’s attention away from his own specialty, his own narrow skills, his own department, and toward the performance of the whole. It turns his attention to the outside, the only place where there are results. He is likely to have to think through what relationships his skills, his specialty, his function, or his department have to the entire organization and its purpose. He therefore will also come to think in terms of the customer, the client, or the patient, who is the ultimate reason for whatever the organization produces, whether it be economic goods, governmental policies, or health services. As a result, what he does and how he does it will be materially different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-areas-of-contribution&quot;&gt;Three Areas of Contribution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;direct results&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;value building and reaffirmation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;developing people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If deprived of performance in any one of these areas, it will decay and die. All three therefore have to be built into the contribution of every executive. But their relative importance varies greatly with the personality and the position of the executive as well as with the needs of the organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you focus on contribution, it will help you fulfill the four basic requirements of effective human relations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;communications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;teamwork&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;self-development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;development of others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping others be successful:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives find themselves asking other people in the organization, their superiors, their subordinates, but above all, their colleagues in other areas: ‘What contribution from me do you require to make your contribution to the organization? When do you need this, how do you need it, and in what form?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all, the biggest benefit of focusing on contribution is it counteracts chaos and highlights what’s important to spend time on versus what’s noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The focus on contribution imposes an organizing principle. It imposes relevance on events. Focusing on contribution turns one of the inherent weaknesses of the executive’s situation—his dependence on other people, his being within the organization—into a source of strength. It creates a team. Finally, focusing on contribution fights the temptation to stay within the organization. It leads the executive—especially the top-level man—to lift his eyes from the inside of efforts, work, and relationships, to the outside; that is, to the results of the organization. It makes him try hard to have direct contact with the outside—whether markets and customers, patients in a community, or the various “publics” which are the outside of a government agency. To focus on contribution is to focus on effectiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-strengths-productive&quot;&gt;Making Strengths Productive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drucker makes the argument that it’s best to build on strengths to achieve results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The effective executive fills positions and promotes on the basis of what a man can do. He does not make staffing decisions to minimize weaknesses but to maximize strength.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;staffing-for-strength&quot;&gt;Staffing for Strength&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two rules to staff for strengths:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look for strength in one major area. Ask, ‘what can this person do uncommonly well?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make each job demanding with a deep scope so their strengths can produce significant results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…every people-decision is a gamble. By basing it on what a man can do, it becomes at least a rational gamble.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spotting-team-members-not-using-their-strengths&quot;&gt;Spotting Team Members Not Using Their Strengths&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s your responsibility to spot and guide those on your team who aren’t making their strength’s productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The ones who are enthusiastic and who, in turn, have results to show for their work, are the ones whose abilities are being challenged and used. Those that are deeply frustrated all say, in one way or another: ‘My abilities are not being put to use.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s your job to know when this is happening, correct it, and be ahead of it so it’s unlikely to occur again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The assertion that “somebody else will not let me do anything” should always be suspected as a cover-up for inertia. But even where the situation does set limitations—and everyone lives and works within rather stringent limitations—there are usually important, meaningful, pertinent things that can be done. The effective executive looks for them. If he starts out with the question: “What can I do?” he is almost certain to find that he can actually do much more than he has time and resources for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-things-first&quot;&gt;First Things First&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effectiveness is reached by focusing on one thing at time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Concentration is necessary precisely because the executive faces so many tasks clamoring to be done. For doing one thing at a time means doing it fast. The more one can concentrate time, effort, and resources, the greater the number and diversity of tasks one can actually perform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you don’t focus on one thing at a time, you end up working harder and at the same time get nothing done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The people who get nothing done often work a great deal harder. In the first place, they underestimate the time for any one task. They always expect that everything will go right. Yet, as every executive knows, nothing ever goes right. The unexpected always happens—the unexpected is indeed the only thing one can confidently expect. And almost never is it a pleasant surprise. Effective executives therefore allow a fair margin of time beyond what is actually needed. In the second place, the typical (that is, the more or less ineffectual) executive tries to hurry—and that only puts him further behind. Effective executives do not race. They set an easy pace but keep going steadily. Finally, the typical executive tries to do several things at once. Therefore, he never has the minimum time quantum for any of the tasks in his program. If any one of them runs into trouble, his entire program collapses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always stay updated to the current programs, activities, and tasks. If something isn’t worth doing anymore, it’s better to stop it sooner than later and refocus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Systematic sloughing off of the old is the one and only way to force the new. There is no lack of ideas in any organization I know. “Creativity” is not our problem. But few organizations ever get going on their own good ideas. Everybody is much too busy on the tasks of yesterday. Putting all programs and activities regularly on trial for their lives and getting rid of those that cannot prove their productivity work wonders in stimulating creativity even in the most hidebound bureaucracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Concentration—that is, the courage to impose on time and events his own decision as to what really matters and comes first—is the executive’s only hope of becoming the master of time and events instead of their whipping boy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-elements-of-decision-making&quot;&gt;The Elements of Decision-Making&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drucker has a lot to say on decision making and how to do it effecively. I found these two sections way too long and verbose for my attention span. Although, I really like the below quote about how data-driven decisions should be seen as having a degree of risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Finding the appropriate measurement is thus not a mathematical exercise. It is a risk-taking judgment. Whenever one has to judge, one must have alternatives among which one can choose. A judgment in which one can only say “yes” or “no” is no judgment at all. Only if there are alternatives can one hope to get insight into what is truly at stake. Effective executives therefore insist on alternatives of measurement—so that they can choose the one appropriate one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-topics-on-effectiveness-that-stood-out-to-me&quot;&gt;Other Topics on Effectiveness that Stood Out to Me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generalist-vs-specialist&quot;&gt;Generalist vs specialist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The only meaningful definition of a “generalist” is a specialist who can relate his own small area to the universe of knowledge. Maybe a few people have knowledge in more than a few small areas. But that does not make them generalists; it makes them specialists in several areas. And one can be just as bigoted in three areas as in one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allowing-people-to-take-risks&quot;&gt;Allowing people to take risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Executives also owe it to the organization and to their fellow workers not to tolerate nonperforming individuals in important jobs. It may not be the employees’ fault that they are underperforming, but even so, they have to be removed. People who have failed in a new job should be given the choice to go back to a job at their former level and salary. This option is rarely exercised; such people, as a rule, leave voluntarily, at least when their employers are U.S. firms. But the very existence of the option can have a powerful effect, encouraging people to leave safe, comfortable jobs and take risky new assignments. The organization’s performance depends on employees’ willingness to take such chances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;developing-people&quot;&gt;Developing people&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“An executive’s focus on contribution by itself is a powerful force in developing people. People adjust to the level of the demands made on them. The executive who sets his sights on contribution raises the sights and standards of everyone with whom he works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…executives who take responsibility for contribution in their own work will as a rule demand that their subordinates take responsibility too. They will tend to ask their men: “What are the contributions for which this organization and I, your superior, should hold you accountable? What should we expect of you? What is the best utilization of your knowledge and your ability?” And then communication becomes possible, becomes indeed easy. Once the subordinate has thought through what contribution should be expected of him, the superior has, of course, both the right and the responsibility to judge the validity of the proposed contribution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A superior has responsibility for the work of others. He also has power over the careers of others. Making strengths productive is therefore much more than an essential of effectiveness. It is a moral imperative, a responsibility of authority and position. To focus on weakness is not only foolish; it is irresponsible. A superior owes it to his organization to make the strength of every one of his subordinates as productive as it can be. But even more does he owe it to the human beings over whom he exercises authority to help them get the most out of whatever strength they may have.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Released in July 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/&quot;&gt;Netlify Analytics&lt;/a&gt; is a new add-on to Netlify’s popular hosting and deployment platform. Starting at $9/month, it’s an “expensive” alternative to the analytics king, Google Analytics, which is free. But is it worth it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought it to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-good-about-netlify-analytics&quot;&gt;What is Good About Netlify Analytics?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netlify Analytics doesn’t slow down your website at all since you don’t need to add any code to your site. Installation was as easy as clicking a button in my Netlify backend. And since it’s anonymous and doesn’t use javascript or cookies, users with adblock are still counted and I didn’t need to add any cookie warnings on my site for GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-can-see-in-netlify-analytics&quot;&gt;What You Can See in Netlify Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pageviews&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;unique visitors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;top viewed pages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;top pages/resources not found&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;top sources/referrers (with path)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bandwidth used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-cant-you-see-in-netlify-analytics&quot;&gt;What Can’t You See in Netlify Analytics?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you can’t see beyond the last 30 days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can’t filter by page or change the date range&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can’t look at the top sources for an individual page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can’t see the bounce rate or average time on site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-netlify-analytics-worth-it&quot;&gt;Is Netlify Analytics Worth It?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Not right now. At $9/month for a product whose competitors are free and more capable, everyone was expecting more from this release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/netlify-analytics-pricing.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/netlify-analytics-pricing.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/netlify-analytics-pricing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Netlify Analytics starts at $9/month.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Netlify Analytics starts at $9/month.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You only have one “screen” without a single filter to segment your data.&lt;/strong&gt; Most egregious though is they delete data older than 30 days (or at least it’s not accessible). Second, I need to be able to break down referrer and pageviews by URL so I can see from where and how much traffic specific pages are getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is now, Netlify Analytics is a great product for people who have a simple curiosity for a site or project’s stats. And if you really care about shaving milliseconds off load times or capturing ad block users, Netlify Analytics could be for you. But if you just casually need analytics, are you going to pay $9/month for it? I’m not sure it’s worth it, but many people are happy to give Netlify $9/month for Analytics because their free hosting and deployment platform is so good that they just want to support them. It’s not all bad news for Netlify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But remember, this is version one of Netlify Analytics. If Netlify can improve the product by adding the above features, it very well could be a game changer - something I’m eagerly anticipating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alternatives-to-netlify-analytics&quot;&gt;Alternatives to Netlify Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/fathom-analytics-review&quot;&gt;Fathom Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://simpleanalytics.com/&quot;&gt;Simple Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although both Fathom and Simple Analytics are not server-side analytics, they are both GDPR compliant and focused on user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just signed up for Fathom and will do a review soon to see how it compares to Netlify Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1/28//2020:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been using Fathom Analytics for seven months now. Although it’s not server-side analytics, it’s a cookie-less, privacy-focused Google Analytics alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t “own” your traffic because your blog is on medium.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have less control of converting traffic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medium promotes other peoples’ articles on your own articles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More readers are dedicated to Medium than dedicated to you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the switch wasn’t about the “building a house on rented land” aspect. I was early to Medium publications so I could use my custom domain (regpaq.com) on Medium. Thankfully I got in before they removed this feature so I shouldn’t lose any rankings since I’m still on the same domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what made me want to stop blogging on Medium? The stats.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium’s stats are broken and very limited. I want to be able to see three things for a given period of my choosing. How much is my traffic growing? What’s the distribution of traffic between pages? Where is that traffic coming from? This isn’t possible on Medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problems-with-medium-stats&quot;&gt;The Problems with Medium Stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one huge problem with Medium stats. &lt;strong&gt;They include views of your comments on other people’s articles in your view count!&lt;/strong&gt; And there is no way to filter them out. So no, you can’t see how many total views just your articles received over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/medium-stats.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/medium-stats.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/medium-stats.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My last 30 days blogging on Medium for all articles... and comments.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;My last 30 days blogging on Medium for all articles... and comments.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other major problem is you can only view your traffic in 30 day windows.&lt;/strong&gt; If you got a lot of views one day, you can’t look at just that day’s traffic and see what pages got the most views or where that traffic came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above the graph, Medium suggests you can click a story to see stats for just that story. Unfortunately, when you click on a story it loads a new page and takes five seconds to load. &lt;strong&gt;So you have to click each individual story one by one to uncover which story went “viral” and racked up the most views on a big traffic day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--full gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/medium-referrers.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/medium-referrers.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/medium-referrers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Limited referrer data for a blog post on Medium.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Limited referrer data for a blog post on Medium.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside an individual story’s stats, you can see the list of referrers. But only the domain.&lt;/strong&gt; In the above example, I can’t see which Reddit threads are talking about my article! Which means I can’t see what people are saying and jump in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started blogging on Medium, I knew the stats were limited, but I didn’t know by how much. The reason I moved to Medium in the first place was because I wanted simplicity. I wanted simple metrics. I didn’t want to fiddle with the design. I didn’t want to mess with plugins. I wanted a better editor than WordPress. I just wanted to write. But now things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;limited-customization-on-medium&quot;&gt;Limited Customization on Medium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest pros of blogging on Medium is that the design is all done for you. You don’t have to worry about it. It’s always better to write and publish more than to fiddle with the design. What changed for me was a massive increase in interest in learning HTML and CSS. &lt;strong&gt;By moving off of Medium, my blog is now a showcase for my design and dev skills.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I didn’t go back to WordPress and instead used &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator. It was a much bigger process than I anticipated. I designed the site in Adobe XD then developed it. &lt;strong&gt;The end result is a blog I designed and I developed with articles I wrote and I illustrated. It’s a culmination of many of my skills in a single project.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;static-sites-are-fast&quot;&gt;Static Sites are Fast&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit to a static site is the speed. Because WordPress and Medium use a database, it loads much slower. Here is the Pingdom page speed and Google score comparison of the same article on Medium versus the current static site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/medium-pingdom-old.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/medium-pingdom-old.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;

        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Medium article page speed from Pingdom.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/medium-google-old.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/medium-google-old.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/medium-google-old.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Medium article page speed score from Google.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Medium article page speed score from Google.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/medium-pingdom-new.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/medium-pingdom-new.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/medium-pingdom-new.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Static article page speed from Pingdom.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Static article page speed from Pingdom.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/medium-google-new.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/medium-google-new.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/medium-google-new.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Static article page speed score from Google.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Static article page speed score from Google.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The static site is a massive improvement for speed&lt;/strong&gt; - even without any image optimization. This should improve the bounce rate and thus increase organic rankings. But because people know what to expect when they land on a Medium-designed article, it’s possible the new design increases the bounce rate. I’ll never know for certain because you can’t measure the bounce rate on Medium. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one catch here about the speed of my site. I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;/netlify-analytics-review&quot;&gt;Netlify’s new Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, which is a server side analytics solution. It measures at the server level so it’s not adding an extra request to the page, like Google Analytics would. The problem is Netlify’s Analytics is even worse than Medium’s so I’ll be switching to Google Analytics or Clicky.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-ill-miss-about-blogging-on-medium&quot;&gt;What I’ll Miss About Blogging on Medium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium’s coolest social feature is “claps.” If people like your article, they can clap for it up to 50 times. It’s nice to get and give claps, but it does have a downside. Medium syndicates and recommends articles to other users based on how many claps it gets. &lt;strong&gt;This made me too focused on claps. I even joined three Facebook groups where people just clap for each others’ articles. It’s a stupid game.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll also miss comments until I can figure out a solution. Because static sites don’t have databases, comments are difficult to add. I don’t want to use something like Disqus, which increases load time and prevents me from “owning” the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I won’t miss Medium’s distribution. I never got any meaningful distribution. I could have written more content for more claps, but I didn’t want to play that game.&lt;/strong&gt; I want to write what I want to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now onto finding which analytics tool I’m going to use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Reggie Paquette</name></author><category term="[&quot;all&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Most people stop blogging on Medium because:</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/medium-vs-self-hosted-blog.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/medium-vs-self-hosted-blog.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Stop Comparing Yourself to Others — Use This Benchmark Instead</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stop Comparing Yourself to Others — Use This Benchmark Instead" /><published>2019-02-13T12:11:11-08:00</published><updated>2019-02-13T12:11:11-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others">&lt;p&gt;The frequently given advice to not compare yourself with others and only to who you were yesterday never quite satisfied me. It still left a lot of questions unanswered and I recently discovered on Reddit many other people feel the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/ao04vn/stop_comparing_yourself_to_others_and_start/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent post on r/productivity&lt;/a&gt;, there were some top comments refuting this advice with how they actually like to use jealousy, greed, and wanting to be better than other people as motivation to achieve “greatness.” Not only is comparing yourself to others the wrong way to achieve true greatness, so is comparing yourself to who you were yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Being better than who you were yesterday should be the bare minimum you strive for, because it doesn’t allow you to achieve what you’re fully capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it doesn’t confirm you’re on the right path to begin with. On its own, “compare yourself to who you were yesterday” is only feel-good advice that has very little practical usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why there’s some rationality behind why we tend to compare ourselves to others. You can see in your physical or digital circle who the low achievers are and who the high achievers are — giving you the missing benchmark of effort and success. But in the end, it’s a terrible benchmark that will have devastating effects on your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparing-yourself-to-others-leads-you-to-falsepaths&quot;&gt;Comparing Yourself to Others Leads You to False Paths&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, I was introduced to and befriended a very successful guy who day traded for a living. I didn’t know anything about the world of finance, but seeing the success he had and hearing how much he would make in any given day was exhilarating. &lt;strong&gt;As time went on, my benchmark for effort and success expanded to include his. I began to compare what I had achieved to him. “Success” now meant nothing short of what he had achieved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told myself I needed to do everything I could to achieve that level of success. I decided to learn how to be a day trader and I went so far as to sell my dream car to get the cash to do it. With studying and his mentorship, I started to make a few hundred dollars per week. As my confidence and greed grew, I became less risk-averse. &lt;strong&gt;Half a year later, my losses totaled close to $10k.&lt;/strong&gt; I closed my account and threw my dreams of riches and day trading out the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started to compare myself to him, and what I had to what he had, it led me to abandon my path and join the path that made him successful. I never had any prior interest in stocks or studied the financial markets. I was just chasing the money and that led to disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Using others as a benchmark for success can lead to conformity — it can take you away from what you’re happy and good at doing and put you on a false path — chasing money, status, or attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a never ending trap. There will always be someone to compare yourself to with more money, more status, and more fame that will lead you off your path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each one of us is a completely unique individual with a unique genetic makeup. We’re all raised by different people, with different values, and in different environments — all of which significantly impact our character and what we do in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People will shout, “you can do anything you set your mind to” or “you just need to work harder” or “you’re not sacrificing enough.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/65e0b0f45be5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nat Eliason&lt;/a&gt; made some noise when he called out Gary Vaynerchuk as an example of someone who does this in a piece he wrote titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@nateliason/no-more-struggle-porn-202153a01108&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;No More “Struggle Porn.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While we do need to have ruthless discipline to reach our greatest potential, we cannot ignore the limits imposed on us by the cards we’re dealt or we will forever be dissatisfied with who we are and what we’ve accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s another reason why it doesn’t make sense to compare ourselves to others: luck. &lt;strong&gt;No one’s success is ever only down to luck, but we can’t ignore the role luck plays in success as an “x” factor — it’s unmanageable and unpredictable.&lt;/strong&gt; The only thing in your control is to continually put yourself in positions to catch lucky breaks. And remember: luck is not distributed evenly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Q&amp;amp;A with White House interns, President Obama gave advice on the subject luck has with success and what to focus on instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A lot of times, it’s just happenstance. Or things work out. But being useful? And having a satisfying life? And making a contribution? That is entirely within your control. Orient yourself towards having an impact and making a difference. And you will and you’ll be happy doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instead-of-comparing-yourself-to-others-or-who-you-were-yesterday-find-your-truepath&quot;&gt;Instead of Comparing Yourself to Others Or Who You Were Yesterday, Find Your True Path&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productivity is worthless if you’re on a false path. Your goal and motivation shouldn’t be about just being the best or better than the people in your circles, but creating something useful that can make a difference in peoples’ lives and your community. This is the truest benchmark for success and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;        
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your true path is doing what you were made for — what you feel you have an inclination and natural ability for. This inclination is a reflection of your unique genetic code, deep underlying preferences for particular activities or forms of expression. When you find your true path, you’ll be less inclined to compare your success with someone else. &lt;strong&gt;You will quickly realize their path isn’t a good fit for you.&lt;/strong&gt; And you won’t be as inclined to envy their money, attention, or whatever, because craving those things is a false path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In the end, the money and success that truly last come not to those who focus on such things as goals, but rather to those who focus on mastery and fulfilling their Life’s Task.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Robert Greene, &lt;a href=&quot;/mastery-summary-quotes-robert-greene&quot;&gt;Mastery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to compare yourself to others is restrained when you’re happy and comfortable with who you are, which comes from being on your true path and working on your Life’s Task. You will no longer envy other peoples’ success and happiness, and you will instead be laser-focused on your own work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Don’t aim at success — the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can’t be disciplined, happy, and confident all the time. I’ve made journaling a daily habit of mine to give myself the opportunity to reflect on and ground my thoughts. It’s an exercise that has helped me live a more level-headed and purposeful life.&lt;/p&gt;
