"Reggie was a key member in building our agency's inbound marketing department, from the ground up. Reggie successfully lead eCommerce companies out of the red and into the black in terms of revenue generated from digital marketing efforts. He lead high-performing inbound marketing campaigns from ideation to execution, but wouldn't stop there. The real glory shone from his work when he was able to analyze the results of his efforts and apply them to subsequent campaigns.

However, Reggie's expertise goes beyond measurable results. I can sincerely say that I've never met anyone who is as immersed in the world of inbound marketing as Reggie is. Anyone who has the privilege of working with Reggie can see that he has an infectious passion for inbound marketing. He lives and breathes it. He wouldn't be satisfied with his work unless it produced the highest caliber results, and it consistently would. He brought fresh insight to the table, implemented the use mission-critical analytics tools, and built foundational processes for a newly founded inbound marketing team."
