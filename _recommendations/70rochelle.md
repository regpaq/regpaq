"When I first started my position at EYEMAGINE, Reggie was there to immediately help me navigate the B2B eCommerce world. Not having much experience at the time, I needed a strong leader for guidance, and Reggie was more than willing to help. He showed me how to be an effective inbound marketer and was able to teach me best practices so that I could be self sufficient and help me succeed at my position. I know wherever Reggie goes, he brings with him a world of knowledge and the capability to go far."
