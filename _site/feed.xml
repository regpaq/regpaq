&lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi’s goal is to make personal finance exciting and rewarding, a stark contrast from the dry, guilt-inducing material you typically would associate to the personal finance space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He won’t blame you for spending lots of money on the things you enjoy; the same things most people would tell you is irresponsible to spend so much money on. Instead he encourages you to keep doing it unapologetically.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catch? Cut spending harder in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Spend extravagantly on the things you love, and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His refreshing approach to money comes from the idea that money shouldn’t rule our lives, and instead be a tool to help us enjoy life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, he’ll encourage financial responsibility. Yes, he’ll advocate &lt;a href=&quot;/google-sheets-budget-template&quot;&gt;using a budget&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, he’ll try to persuade you to start saving for retirement immediately. &lt;strong&gt;But what makes Ramit different is he shows you how to get this important stuff done and out of the way by automating it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes room to think about the fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why do you want to be rich?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does being rich mean to you?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What do you love to spend money on?&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;how to automate it all to be hands off&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how to invest intelligently with little work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to briefly cover his main recommendations from each topic, but because of his innovative approach to spending and budgeting and how practical it is, I’m going to spend a bit more time covering them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Everybody teaches you how to save. Nobody talks about how to spend.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-make-credit-cards-work-for-you&quot;&gt;How to Make Credit Cards Work for You&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section covers a lot about what a credit score is, how it’s calculated, and how credit cards work - all great for beginners. These are the notes I took for myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;always use a credit card over a debit card - builds credit, protects your bank account, accrue rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;always pay off credit cards in full each month - treat it like a debit card&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set up automatic payments so you never miss a payment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;keep old credit cards active by charging a small monthly cost to keep credit history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;switch credit cards to a no annual fee card when it’s no longer your primary card&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;request credit limit increases to improve your credit utilization rate (a factor of your credit score)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be aware of and use your rewards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can negotiate lower APRs and get late fees waived if you call and ask&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section ends with strategies to pay off credit card debt. It can be summarized by paying off debt with the highest intrest rate, but it’s more nuanced than that. If you do have credit card debt, this section is worth reading in full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-set-up-the-right-bank-accounts&quot;&gt;How to Set Up The Right Bank Accounts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m always surprised when I learn friends use traditional big banks for their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They typically have the worse benefits, have minimum balance requirements for checking accounts, and a poor online banking experience. Ramit does a good job exposing these pitfalls by explaining how banks make money and the tactics they use to lure you in and make it hard to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a couple, but important takeaways on banks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;switch to an online bank (I recommend Capital One)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open a high-yield savings accounts (Capital One has them for free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-set-up-the-right-retirement-accounts&quot;&gt;How to Set Up The Right Retirement Accounts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the most important section so far, Ramit makes it simple to understand all the different types of retirement accounts and persuasively lays out why it’s so important to start saving for retirement now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He created five systematic steps for investing he calls “The Ladder of Personal Finance.”&lt;/strong&gt; When you finish the first step, or if it’s not an option, you proceed to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;contribute 100% of what your employer matches in a company 401k&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pay off credit card or other debt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open a Roth IRA and contribute up to the annual maximum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;max out your 401k beyond or regardless of a company match&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;put the rest in a non retirement brokerage account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this section goes deep into each step of the ladder, explaining everything very clearly. I was finally able to understand the tax advantages of each different kind of retirement account and also why it was valuable to start now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-manage-spending-and-enjoy-it&quot;&gt;How to Manage Spending and Enjoy It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you can learn to how to better manage your money he says you need to understand where you’re spending it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, he doesn’t recommend creating a budget where you track your finances down to the penny, but instead do what he calls a “Conscious Spending Plan,” which still sounds an awful lot like a budget, just a little more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conscious Spending is Ramit’s method of allowing yourself to spend money on the things that bring you joy, even if they seem frivolous to other people, or even frivolous to you. In exchange, you cut the spending elsewhere. This is how Ramit defines frugality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Frugality isn’t about cutting your spending on everything. That approach wouldn’t last two days. Frugality, quite simply, is about choosing the things you love enough to spend extravagantly on - and then cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t love.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-make-a-conscious-spending-plan&quot;&gt;How to make a conscious spending plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divide up where your take home pay goes into four major buckets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Money Buckets&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Percent of take home pay to allocate&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I. Fixed Costs - Rent, utilities, debt, etc.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;50-60%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;II. Investments - 401(k), Rotha IRA&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;III. Savings - Vacations, gifts, house down payment, unexpected expenses&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5-10%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;IV. Guilt-free spending money - Dining out, drinking, movies, clothes, shoes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;20-35%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed costs are expenses you have to pay every month no matter what. Once you total them up, subtract that amount from your take-home pay.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out how much you want to save for retirement in a 401k and or IRA and then deduct that amount.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think about what you want to save for in the short and long term. Calculate how much you need to save per month to reach that goal and then deduct that amount.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After allocating money for fixed costs, retirement and investments, and savings, the rest is for guilt-free spending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/google-sheets-budget-template&quot;&gt;I made a budget template on Google Sheets&lt;/a&gt; based on Ramit’s Conscious Spending Plan that can you help do all this.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;        
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tips-to-optimize-your-conscious-spending-plan&quot;&gt;Tips to optimize your Conscious Spending Plan:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;always try to cut fixed costs and guilt-free spending before cutting how much you allocate to investing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;focus on big wins to cut spending, not small ones like buying generic brands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you’re more likely to stick to a new budget by making a gradual change than a dramatic one&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;actually write out tangible savings goals to increase motivation to achieve them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-the-envelope-system-to-target-big-wins&quot;&gt;Use the “envelope system” to target big wins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The envelope system is essentially a second bucket system for your guilt-free spending. You allocate a certain amount of your guilt-free spending to certain categories (envelopes) and once you spend all the money in that envelope, that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s much easier to figure out how much money you should put into each envelope by looking at your last three months of spending in each category, averaging them out, and then setting an achievable goal for each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a good objective to try and meet your spending goal for each category, but you can dip into other envelopes if you need to. The most important thing is keeping your total spending below what you have for guilt-free spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;activity-based-envelopes&quot;&gt;Activity based envelopes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One trick Ramit mentions that I’ve used in the past is instead of using the general categories that credit card companies and banks typically use, create categories more personal to you and &lt;em&gt;around events&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I have used these categories in the past:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;eating out alone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coffee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;alcohol for home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;going out with friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this requires a manual categorization of each expense, it will highglight the driving activities behind your spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to keep track of spending is to always use a credit card (as long as your responsible) so you can just pull up your account to enter expenses into your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The best part about setting up a strategic budget is that it guides your decisions, letting you say no much more easily - ‘Sorry, it’s not in my plan this month.’ - and freeing you up to enjoy what you do spend on. This is guilt-free spending at its best.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-automate-it-all-to-be-hands-off&quot;&gt;How to Automate It All to be Hands Off&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re contributing to a 401k, that’s probably already automated by your employer before even receiving your paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then your paycheck gets deposited into your checking account and from there you set up a monthly automatic transfer to your other retirement and savings accounts. &lt;strong&gt;By transferring the money automatically right after you get paid, you’re paying yourself first, not spending first and saving what’s left over.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s why the money left over to spend is guilt-free spending money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the flow looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;How to automate your finances. Automatically transfer to savings first. Your percentage allocation may differ.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“By setting up an automatic payment plan you actually make it difficult to stop the contributions to your retirement account! Not because you can’t - you can adjust your system any time - but because you’re lazy and you won’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More automation tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set up all bills to be paid by credit card automatically&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if a bill (like rent) can’t be paid by card, set up auto bill pay to have your bank automtically send a check on your behalf&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set up your credit card bill to be paid automatically from your checking account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set a reminder in the middle of the month to check how you much you’ve spent compared to what you’ve allocated for guilt-free spending&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-invest-intelligently-with-little-work&quot;&gt;How to Invest Intelligently with Little Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section of &lt;em&gt;I Will Teach You to be Rich&lt;/em&gt;, Ramit walks us through how to invest the money in your 401ks and IRAs. It’s a good introduction to the foundational topics of investing that can be summed up in a few points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be less risk averse when you’re younger, more risk averse when older&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hardly anyone beats the market, even full-time investors so it’s not worth trying to pick the right stocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t invest in any funds with high fees, like mutual funds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it’s better long term to invest in low-fee index funds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some diversification is good, just remember to rebalance your ratios annually&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;invest in lifecycle funds to be completely hands off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramit goes into more details on each one of these here and explains why he gives the advice he does. It’s solid financial advice and worth reading more into if you’re fresh to personal finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-personal-finance-tips&quot;&gt;Final Personal Finance Tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;try and invest as much as you can, as early as you can&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if your income increases, look to increase how much you allocate to savings first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ignore the noise of the financial industry, it can cause you to get emotional and make bad decisions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t worry about tricks to avoid taxes or seeing a financial advisor until your investments total $100k+&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;create an emergency fund to protect against job loss or unexpected, expensive bills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Unlike other people, who worry about money (because they never learned how it works), you get to focus on the things you love.”&lt;/p&gt;

It seems we choose our beliefs. It seems we have the capacity to make our own choices. It seems we control our actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems everything we think and do is of our own free will and this all seems quite obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there does exist the opposite belief that we don’t have free will to choose all those things ourselves and rather our thoughts, beliefs, choices, and actions are determined only by a result of previous causes that could not have resulted in any other outcome. &lt;strong&gt;This philosophical belief is called determinism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned about determinism from Sam Harris and my first reaction was &lt;em&gt;no way that’s even close to being right, of course we have free will&lt;/em&gt;. But after listening to his arguments and doing my own research on determinism, I can’t help but be convinced it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This realization had such a profound effect on me it has fundamentally changed the way I think about myself, other people, and the world around me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is an examination into determinism versus free will, thought exercises to illustrate the lack of free will in our thoughts, beliefs, choices, and actions, and finally the implications of it in our daily lives and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;free-will-vs-determinism&quot;&gt;Free Will vs Determinism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism#History&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Determinism&lt;/a&gt; is the philosophical belief that any thought you have, belief you uphold, choice you make, and action you take is determined by a chain of previous causes that could not be otherwise because of those causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Free will&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, is the belief we have the unimpeded ability to control our thoughts, choose our beliefs, make choices, and take actions between different possible options. &lt;strong&gt;The key question that differentiates determinism and free will is &lt;em&gt;are you capable to have done otherwise?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Harris did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/w8Q6CWv7IXo?t=8106&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;great thought exercise on the Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate the difference. It goes like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of a city - any city in the world. &lt;em&gt;Now say it out loud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could have chosen any of the hundreds of cities you know the name of, &lt;em&gt;but you chose that one.&lt;/em&gt; Some other cities might have run through your head right before you answered, but there were hundreds that didn’t even occur to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the hundreds of possible options, this seems like an example of one of the freest choices you can make. But if we go back in time right to the moment where I first asked you to say the city out loud, &lt;em&gt;could you have chosen a different city?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you examine your thought process leading to your city of choice, you’ll find reasons that caused you to choose that city - fond memories, something you saw today, or simply how you were feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a universe with free will, you’d be capable of using those inputs to choose one city and you could have easily chosen a different city. But in a deterministic universe, we could go back 1,000 times right to the start of this thought exercise and you’d go through that same exact thought process and you’d choose that same city every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s the difference between free will and determinism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arguments-for-determinism&quot;&gt;Arguments for Determinism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are thought exercises to reveal how much of who we are, our thoughts, beliefs, choices, and actions are the product of causes rather than choices from our own free will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-didnt-choose-our-genetics-or-upbringing&quot;&gt;We didn’t choose our genetics or upbringing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, we’re alive. And it wasn’t by choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t get to choose the country or city we were born and raised in. We didn’t choose the culture. We didn’t choose the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t get to choose our genetic code, how tall we’d become, how attractive or unattractive we are, the sound of our voice, the color of our skin, the language we speak, our natural talents, our gender or sex, or the diseases we’re susceptible to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t get to choose our parents, how much or how little money they had to raise us with, their relationship between each other, the religion, values, and politics they ingrained in us, or how much or how little they pushed us in sports, music, or academics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How our parents raised us (or the people who did), heavily influence our identity, character, values, beliefs, and future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re a parent, you already know this is true or you wouldn’t have read all those books or watched all those videos on how to become a great parent. You wouldn’t have tried as hard as you did to create the best possible life for your children if you knew it wouldn’t make a difference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to think about your upbringing. How much has it made you who you are today? How much of that was your choice? How much of that was determined and out of your control?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-dont-choose-our-own-thoughts&quot;&gt;We don’t choose our own thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the part of us that feels closest to our sense of free will, our thoughts seem to be the element we have complete control of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we are in complete control of our thoughts, &lt;strong&gt;why do we struggle with staying focused and distractions? It’s not that we choose to be distracted. It happens “against our will” because we don’t have the control to choose what we think about.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’ve ever practiced meditation, you already know how frequently random thoughts surface themselves, completely outside of our control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not only do we not choose what and when we think about things, we don’t choose our opinion of things either. &lt;strong&gt;If we did have free will and complete control of choosing our opinions, marketing and advertising wouldn’t be a multi billion dollar industry fighting for our attention,&lt;/strong&gt; we wouldn’t be the average of the five people we surround ourselves with, &lt;a href=&quot;/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others&quot;&gt;social media wouldn’t affect our mental health&lt;/a&gt;, and good and bad influences wouldn’t make a difference to our character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the many things that influence every thought and opinion we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if we don’t choose the things we think about, when we think about them, and our opinions of them, how can we possibly ever have a thought or opinion formed purely from our choice alone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-dont-choose-our-own-beliefs&quot;&gt;We don’t choose our own beliefs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to think of a strong belief you have, such as a religious belief or political position. What is your best reason for believing your belief or position is right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever your best reason was, it wasn’t &lt;em&gt;because I chose to believe it,&lt;/em&gt; was it? &lt;strong&gt;That’s because we don’t choose our beliefs. We’re convinced of them. It’s only until we’re convinced of a belief that we can uphold that belief with conviction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate this is true, see if you’re capable of choosing to believe the opposite view of the belief or position you were just thinking of. Could you do it? If you believe the Earth is a sphere, can you choose to believe right now, with complete conviction, that it’s flat? The reason why you can’t is because you’ve already been presented with good reasons why it’s a sphere and good reasons why it’s not flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need good reasons to believe something, and making a choice to believe something is never a good enough reason for a strong belief to form.&lt;/strong&gt; So what is a good enough reason?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To our detriment, a good enough reason is anything that sounds more convincing to us than what we knew before and it’s here wherein lies the problem. We can be convinced to uphold false beliefs for objectively bad reasons. These bad, but convincing, reasons are often &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;logical fallacies&lt;/a&gt; strengthened through &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourbias.is/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cognitive biases&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s why some people do believe the Earth is flat with complete conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And consider for a moment why we even have the beliefs we do in the first place. Beliefs are pushed onto us from every angle since birth from our parents, teachers and textbooks, church and church leaders, community and culture, the news media, and on and on. &lt;strong&gt;Then we have social media that exacerbates the problem by isolating us into echo chambers that feed into our confirmation bias.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, because we don’t choose which beliefs are up for consideration in the first place and we can’t choose which to uphold, it’s clear our beliefs are determined, not chosen by our own free will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-dont-make-our-own-choices&quot;&gt;We don’t make our own choices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Harris’s ‘pick a city’ thought exercise is a demonstration of how we use previous causes to make a choice. Although this is an example of one of the freest choices you can make, it is an inconsequential choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely life’s more consequential choices where we spend weeks reflecting and deliberating over the pros and cons of that choice has to be an example of using free will to make a choice, right? Let’s explore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you’re deciding which college to go to for your bachelor’s degree. The pros and cons you might be deliberating over are the schools’ prestiges, quality of major programs, how much fun you’ll have, and where your parents want you to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your genetics, upbringing, thoughts, opinions, and beliefs will determine your final assessment for each of these considerations. &lt;strong&gt;These are the tools we use to make decisions and if our decision making tools are determined, then the choices we end up making from them are determined.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, neither the time it takes to make a choice or the level of consequence in a choice’s outcome changes the fact that our choices are determined. We’re still capable of making choices in a deterministic universe, but we are never capable of choosing something else than what we do end up choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;        
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-dont-control-our-own-actions&quot;&gt;We don’t control our own actions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actions can occur either unconsciously or consciously. Unconscious actions like scratching an itch, sighing, or bouncing your leg up and down while sitting are actions that occur, without a doubt, from a cause, not by choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conscious actions require a choice to act. And if choices are determined, then actions are determined.&lt;/strong&gt; We can even make a choice to act and still fail to complete that act because causes are more powerful than our choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means we don’t have complete control of our actions or body. If we did, we wouldn’t choose to &lt;a href=&quot;/how-to-break-bad-habits&quot;&gt;break a bad habit&lt;/a&gt; and fail. We wouldn’t choose to &lt;a href=&quot;/how-to-make-habits-stick&quot;&gt;start a good habit&lt;/a&gt; and fail. We wouldn’t need to read a &lt;a href=&quot;/atomic-habits-review-notes-lessons&quot;&gt;book on habits&lt;/a&gt; at all. If we had free will and control of our actions, we could simply choose to do something and do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we don’t have control of our actions because we don’t have control of our choices. We don’t have control of our choices because we don’t have control of our beliefs. We don’t have control of our beliefs because we don’t have control of our thoughts, opinions, genetics, or how we were raised.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;        
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-the-lack-of-free-will-matter&quot;&gt;Does the Lack of Free Will Matter?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determining whether we have free will or not matters because if we do have free will, that means we should have full, moral responsibility for our actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we don’t have free will, how much moral responsibility should we bear for actions we could not have done otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Admitting that free will is an illusion actually does have some important consequences. They’re not the kind of consequences that people worry about. It’s not that you have no basis to be a better person or to change your life or to make efforts to improve yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“That all remains intact, but it does change our ethical views of good and evil in some important ways.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sam Harris, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/w8Q6CWv7IXo?t=8319&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Joe Rogan Experience #543 2:18:39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, let’s look at what the lack of free will means for our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-be-too-hard-on-yourself&quot;&gt;Don’t be too hard on yourself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be disappointed with the way you look, how much money you make, or how many followers you have. You might &lt;a href=&quot;/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others&quot;&gt;compare yourself to others&lt;/a&gt; and be disappointed with how ordinary or inadequate you are compared to them. I’ve been there and I think we’ve all been there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By understanding that we don’t have control over the causes that determine our looks, income, popularity, or status, it becomes possible to accept who we are and be grateful for what we have.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/picture&gt;
                &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;        
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most empowering tenets of Stoicism and why I’ve fully embraced its philosophy into my life is about identifying and separating the things that are up to us from what’s not. If something is not up to us and is out of our control, then we shouldn’t get angry, scared, or grieve about it because there’s nothing we could have done to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When a slave runs away from his master, we call him a fugitive slave. But the law of nature is a master too, and to break it is to become a fugitive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“To feel grief, anger, or fear is to try to escape from something decreed by the ruler of all things, now or in the past or in the future. And that ruler is law [fate], which governs what happens to each of us. To feel grief or anger or fear is to become a fugitive — a fugitive from justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius,  &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 10.25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infusing determinism and Stoicism into my perspective has shown me that getting angry, sad, and frustrated with who and where I am today would be denying that my previous causes could not have been anything else than what they were.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, these negative emotions are unnecessary. All they do is bring extra harm for no rational reason. Identifying the things that are outside of my control has &lt;a href=&quot;/virtue-is-its-own-reward&quot;&gt;ultimately brought tranquility into my life.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-good-to-other-people&quot;&gt;Be good to other people&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just as you recognize the things you can’t control about yourself, it’s just as powerful to recognize other people are the way they are and do the things they do because of causes outside of their control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So think about that the next time your significant other, a family member, friend, or coworker does something you find weird or wrong. It doesn’t seem weird or wrong to them because of their previous causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to choose [how to react].”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius,  &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 7.22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have objectively good reasons for thinking whatever they’re doing is weird or wrong, they may just not know better and that’s okay. If you’re able to, try and steer them in the right direction. &lt;strong&gt;The worst thing you can do for your relationship and your own well-being, is pass blame.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If it’s in your control, why do you do it? If it’s in someone else’s, then who are you blaming? Atoms? The gods? Stupid either way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Blame no one. Set people straight, if you can. If not, just repair the damage. And suppose you can’t do that either. Then where does blaming people get you?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius,  &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 8.17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeing the universe, yourself, and other people through a lens of determinism and Stoicism adds a priceless attribute to your character: empathy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-more-aware-of-what-influences-you&quot;&gt;Be more aware of what influences you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally everything and everyone around us is influencing our thoughts, beliefs, and behavior in every moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pay attention to your thoughts and emotions throughout the day. Try to understand what made you think and feel that way.&lt;/em&gt; By being able to identify the cause, we can cut out the negative influences and increase the positive ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius often draws a comparison between being unaware of your influences to “being jerked like a puppet by our own impulses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s time you realized that you have something in you more powerful and miraculous than the things that affect you and make you dance like a puppet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“What’s in my thoughts at this moment? Fear? Jealousy? Desire? Feelings like that?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius,  &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 12.19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “power” he’s referring to is our ability to be aware of these influences and how we choose to react to them. This is a skill that takes practice. Meditation is the most popular method to get better at it, but I’ve found &lt;a href=&quot;/stoic-journal-topics&quot;&gt;daily journaling&lt;/a&gt; to work better for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly realized social media and video games were some of my biggest negative influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the expense of losing touch with some friends, I deleted Snapchat and Instagram because it made me &lt;a href=&quot;/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others&quot;&gt;care too much about what other people think of me&lt;/a&gt;, envy the lives other people live and the things they have, and lose gratitude for who I am and what I have in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sold my Playstation because all I wanted to do was game when I got off work. I realized it was an unproductive use of time and losing online games would leave me annoyed and frustrated (FIFA players understand).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-on-politics-and-society&quot;&gt;Impact on politics and society&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perspective of empathy through determinism and Stoicism can be extended to people who live on the opposite side of the globe, who we don’t understand, and who society deems bad. Through practicing this perspective, it’s possible to develop empathy for these people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, people in jail for committing crimes have previous causes that led them to do so, whether those crimes are theft, drug related, or assault. While determinism doesn’t mean our society must rid all fault and responsibility from those who commit crimes, but maybe we should emphasize an approach of rehabilitation more than punishment in our criminal justice system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should be more empathetic to people who were born in a third world country through no choice of their own. Maybe we should be more empathetic to people who have different religious beliefs and political positions due to causes outside of their control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some critics say there isn’t much of a practical difference between free will and the illusion of it, there are clear implications to the understanding of ourselves, other people, and the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge yourself to be aware of the influences on your thoughts, beliefs, and behavior. Challenge yourself to accept and be grateful for who you are, what you have, and what you’ve accomplished. Challenge yourself to feel affection for other people even when they make mistakes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Reggie Paquette</name></author><category term="[&quot;all&quot;]" /><summary type="html">It seems we have control of our thoughts.

&lt;p&gt;Or in other words, build the biggest legacy. &lt;strong&gt;And if my life ended without a legacy, if there wasn’t a large subset of people who remembered me or knew who I was even just 50 years after I died, my life was… well meaningless.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a demoralizing point-of-view, but I couldn’t reason or justify a better measurement for meaning. I’d rather accept a harsh reality as true than keep my head in the sand and believe a false reality to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I was conflicted when reading how strong &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Marcus Aurelius&lt;/a&gt; and the Stoics believed accepting fate and doing good as the highest objective he strived to achieve in life. This is one of my favorite Aurelius quotes about this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be good. Like gold or emerald or purple repeating to itself, “No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be emerald, my color undiminished.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 7.15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this quote because he says his task is to be good, like an emerald’s task is to be emerald in color. An emerald can’t be anything but emerald. And Aurelius strives to be good to his core so he couldn’t do anything but good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I didn’t understand how striving to achieve virtue could lead to a meaningful life. But then I understood Aurelius didn’t seek to achieve meaning. &lt;strong&gt;Rather, he sought to achieve goodness.&lt;/strong&gt; So what did Aurelius know about meaning to disregard it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;according-to-marcus-aurelius-life-and-legacy-are-trivial-and-meaningless&quot;&gt;According to Marcus Aurelius, Life and Legacy are Trivial and Meaningless&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s my understanding that Aurelius never believed in a “meaningful” life. In one meditation, he equated the entirety of life to a rock being thrown in the air and coming back down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A rock thrown in the air. It loses nothing by coming down, gained nothing by going up.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 9.17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another, he wrote about exercising awareness in the moment, not to appreciate it, but to realize it’s not much to miss out on when he dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Stop whatever you’re doing for a moment and ask yourself: Am I afraid of death because I won’t be able to do this anymore?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 10.29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the impression Aurelius believed life was something that had to be done and put up with as fate demanded. Why? Because death scared him and he wanted to believe he wouldn’t be missing out on anything when he died to better cope with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Human lives are brief and trivial. Yesterday a blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid, ash.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it up without complaint.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 4.48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-aurelius-had-to-say-about-legacy-and-fame&quot;&gt;What Aurelius had to say about legacy and fame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacies are born out of fame and Aurelius had a disdain for it for two reasons. If you’re working towards achieving fame, it means you care too much about what other people think of you. And second, fame doesn’t last long so it’s pointless to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…look at how soon we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us - how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space…”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 4.3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter if people remember you 50 years after death or 200, you will still be forgotten. Think about how many people you know of the names of who were alive 200 years ago in 1819. There was a billion people alive in the world then. Can you name more than five?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“So many who were remembered already forgotten, and those who remembered them long gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-criticisms-of-marcus-aureliuss-point-of-view&quot;&gt;My Criticisms of Marcus Aurelius’s Point-of-View&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on my interpretation of Aurelius’s beliefs, legacy, fame, and being remembered is meaningless. And life itself is void of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only criticism is you can take two people, and objectively determine which had more impact, and thus more meaning. For example, taken to the extreme, it’s easy to identify who had more impact and meant more to society: Steve Jobs vs the average joe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to point out that impact could be positive or negative. For example, Martin Luther King Jr vs Osama Bin Laden. Both had great impact on society, but in opposite directions. If, for sake of argument, we quantified their impact as equal would their meaning be equal? Does meaning take into account positive vs negative impact? I think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius and the Stoics believed being virtuous and doing good as the highest objective. &lt;strong&gt;Then, according to Stoicism, wouldn’t someone who does more good than another have both more impact and more meaning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stoics argued that the only thing in our control is our mind. And it’s rare for people to make an impact at the level of Jobs or MLK. If all it took to make a high impact was desire and tenacity, there would be a lot more people making that high of an impact. But there are lot of factors outside of our control, which makes the highest level of achievement impossible for most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, while there may be objective measures to determine if a life is more impactful or meaningful than another, it’s fruitless to pursue it and make it your highest objective. Instead, the Stoics argue it’s best to make virtue and doing good the highest objective, which is entirely within our control. I’m beginning to understand why.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-how-virtue-is-its-own-reward&quot;&gt;Understanding How Virtue is Its Own Reward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailystoic.com/4-stoic-virtues/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ryan Holiday puts it&lt;/a&gt;, “A Stoic believes they don’t control the world around them, only how they respond — and that they must always respond with courage, temperance, wisdom, and justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the four core virtues of Stoicism. Aurelius believed &lt;strong&gt;justice&lt;/strong&gt; was the most important, because acting with justice is doing good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“And a commitment to justice in your own acts. Which means: thought and action resulting in the common good. What you were born to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 9.31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completed &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations&lt;/a&gt; for the first time two years ago. Since then, I’ve been adopting a Stoic mindset and I’ve seen myself undergo a dramatic transformation. Acting with justice and virtue has given me a new level of patience and resilience, improved my relationships, and fostered an affection for all people. It has redirected my ambition from building a legacy and longing for recognition to a mission of doing good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing out how acting with justice has helped me in all these ways, but I can’t explain it better than Marcus Aurelius himself. Here are some of my favorite meditations on doing good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to choose.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 7.22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you’ll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger. Your sense of good and evil may be the same as theirs, or near it, in which case you have to excuse them. Or your sense of good and evil may differ from theirs. In which case they’re misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To do harm is to do yourself harm. To do an injustice is to do yourself an injustice - it degrades you.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 9.4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When faced with people’s bad behavior, turn around ask when &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; have acted like that. When you saw money as good, or pleasure, or social position. Your anger will subside as soon as you recognize that they acted under compulsion (what else could they do?)…”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 10.30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“That you don’t know for sure it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a mistake. A lot of things are means to some other end. You have to know an awful lot before you can judge other people’s actions with real understanding.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 11.18.v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you believe doing good as the highest objective, you feel good when you do it. &lt;strong&gt;Acting with justice and virtue is its own reward because acting virtuously is synonymous with doing good to others and preserving your integrity. With self fulfillment and happiness as a bonus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What is the goal of virtue, after all, except a life that flows smoothly?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Epictetus, Book I, 108&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave you with one last meditation that sums up Aurelius’s and the Stoics point-of-view and reason for doing good as the highest objective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…And how does it injure you anyway? You’ll find that none of the people you’re upset about has done anything that could do damage to your mind. But that’s all that “harm” or “injury” could mean. Yes, boorish people do boorish things. What’s strange or unheard of about that? Isn’t it yourself you should reproach - for not anticipating that they’d act this way? The logos gave you the means to see it - that a person would act a given way - but you paid no attention. And now you’re astonished that he’s gone and done it. So when you call someone “untrustworthy” or “ungrateful,” turn the reproach on yourself. It was you who did wrong. By assuming that someone with those traits deserved your trust. Or by doing them a favor and expecting something in return, instead of looking to the action itself for your reward. What else did you expect from helping someone out? Isn’t it enough that you’ve done what your nature demands? You want a salary for it, too? As if your eyes expected a reward for seeing, or your feet for walking. That’s what they were made for. By doing what they were designed to do, they’re performing their function. Whereas humans were made to help others. And when we do help others - or help them to do something - we’re doing what we were designed for. We perform our function.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask “what needs to be done?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask “what is right for the company?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop action plans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take responsibility for decisions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take responsibility for communicating&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on opportunities rather than problems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run productive meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think and say “we” rather than “I”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two give you the knowledge you need. The next four convert that knowledge into effective action. The last two gets your team to feel responsible and inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Effective Executive, Drucker explains what an effective executive is and how to become one. He believed being an effective executive could be learned and this book served as a handbook to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Executives are doers; they execute. Knowledge is useless to executives until it has been translated into deeds. But before springing into action, the executive needs to plan his course. He needs to think about desired results, probable restraints, future revisions, check-in points, and implications for how he’ll spend his time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-makes-an-executive-effective&quot;&gt;What Makes an Executive Effective?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking “what do I want to do?” ask “what has to be done?” This is crucial for managerial success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The answer to this question “…almost always contains more than one urgent task. But effective executives do not splinter themselves. They concentrate on one task if at all possible. […] I have never encountered an executive who remains effective while tackling more than two tasks at a time. Hence, after asking what needs to be done, the effective executive sets priorities and sticks to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have the top initiatives prioritized, you need to choose which you are especially good at undertaking and then delegate the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives try to focus on jobs they’ll do especially well. They know that enterprises perform if top management performs—and don’t if it doesn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-is-the-beginning-of-your-action-plan&quot;&gt;This is the beginning of your action plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your action plan is a prioritized list of initiatives and tasks for you and your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The action plan is a statement of intentions rather than a commitment. It must not become a straitjacket. It should be revised often, because every success creates new opportunities. So does every failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Develop the plan in a tool that makes it easy to check-in, provide updates, and move items around as it progresses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Napoleon allegedly said that no successful battle ever followed its plan. Yet Napoleon also planned every one of his battles, far more meticulously than any earlier general had done. Without an action plan, the executive becomes a prisoner of events. And without check-ins to reexamine the plan as events unfold, the executive has no way of knowing which events really matter and which are only noise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And an action plan is useless unless it’s communicated and understood by your teams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decision has not really been made until people know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who is accountable for delivering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the deadline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who and which teams are affected by the decision and therefore have to understand and approve it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who else should be informed of the decision, even if not directly affected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action plan shouldn’t be given as an order from the top. Get and incorporate feedback. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives make sure that both their action plans and their information needs are understood. Specifically, this means that they share their plans with and ask for comments from all their colleagues—superiors, subordinates, and peers. At the same time, they let each person know what information they’ll need to get the job done. The information flow from subordinate to boss is usually what gets the most attention. But executives need to pay equal attention to peers’ and superiors’ information needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although problems stick out like a nail begging to be hammered, don’t make fixing a problem a top priority.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Good executives focus on opportunities rather than problems. Problems have to be taken care of, of course; they must not be swept under the rug. But problem solving, however necessary, does not produce results. It prevents damage. Exploiting opportunities produces results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when delegating tasks…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives put their best people on opportunities rather than on problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Drucker recalls how an effective executive would run a meeting, he thinks back on an old colleague of his.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“At the beginning of a formal meeting, Sloan announced the meeting’s purpose. He then listened. He never took notes and he rarely spoke except to clarify a confusing point. At the end he summed up, thanked the participants, and left. Then he immediately wrote a short memo addressed to one attendee of the meeting. In that note, he summarized the discussion and its conclusions and spelled out any work assignment decided upon in the meeting (including a decision to hold another meeting on the subject or to study an issue). He specified the deadline and the executive who was to be accountable for the assignment. He sent a copy of the memo to everyone who’d been present at the meeting. It was through these memos—each a small masterpiece—that Sloan made himself into an outstandingly effective executive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;effectiveness-can-be-learned&quot;&gt;Effectiveness Can Be Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing to come up with a good idea. It’s another thing all together to execute that idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself achievement. […] Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;effective-executive-are-masters-of-their-time&quot;&gt;Effective Executive Are Masters of Their Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the most out of your time and your team’s time is an essential first step to becoming effecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[Effective executives] start with their time. And they do not start out with planning. They start by finding out where their time actually goes. Then they attempt to manage their time and to cut back unproductive demands on their time. Finally they consolidate their “discretionary” time into the largest possible continuing units.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To master your time, follow this three step process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;record your time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;manage your time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;consolidate your time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The first step toward executive effectiveness is therefore to record actual time-use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tips-on-recording-time&quot;&gt;Tips on Recording Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measure it in real-time, not later from memory&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recording time is a habit that can improve with constant effort&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out how to make time management systematic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve been recording your time, you can analyze it and see what the time wasters are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To find these time-wastes, one asks of all activities in the time records: ‘What would happen if this were not done at all?’ And if the answer is, ‘Nothing would happen,’ then obviously the conclusion is to stop doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then determine which of the activities left can be delegated to some else. Now you can see how much time you have for important tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The executive who records and analyzes his time and then attempts to manage it can determine how much he has for his important tasks. How much time is there that is “discretionary,” that is, available for the big tasks that will really make a contribution? It is not going to be a great deal, no matter how ruthlessly the executive prunes time-wasters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drucker discovered that it’s much more effective to block open time in as large of chunks as possible to get into deep work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The effective executive therefore knows that he has to consolidate his [open] time. He knows that he needs large chunks of time and that small driblets are no time at all. Even one quarter of the working day, if consolidated in large time units, is usually enough to get the important things done. But even three quarters of the working day are useless if they are only available as fifteen minutes here or half an hour there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Time is the scarcest resource, and unless it is managed, nothing else can be managed. The analysis of one’s time, moreover, is the one easily accessible and yet systematic way to analyze one’s work and to think through what really matters in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executives-are-also-responsible-for-their-teams-time&quot;&gt;Executives are Also Responsible for Their Team’s Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common time waste is when the executive wastes his individual team members’ time. To overcome this, Drucker advises executives to directly as their team if and how he/she wastes their time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives have learned to ask systematically and without coyness: “What do I do that wastes your time without contributing to your effectiveness?” To ask this question, and to ask it without being afraid of the truth, is a mark of the effective executive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tips-on-managing-meetings&quot;&gt;Tips on Managing Meetings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like to be “in the know” and aware of what’s going on. Effective executives should let the whole team know when a meeting will take place and on what topic. Make it optional for people to join so they don’t feel left out. In any case, summarize the meeting notes, send to the team, and allow for questions and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Meetings are by definition a concession to deficient organization for one either meets or one works. One cannot do both at the same time. In an ideally designed structure (which in a changing world is of course only a dream) there would be no meetings. Everybody would know what he needs to know to do his job. Everyone would have the resources available to him to do his job. We meet because people holding different jobs have to cooperate to get a specific task done. We meet because the knowledge and experience needed in a specific situation are not available in one head, but have to be pieced together out of the experience and knowledge of several people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to run meetings effectively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The effective man always states at the outset of a meeting the specific purpose and contribution it is to achieve. He makes sure that the meeting addresses itself to this purpose. He does not allow a meeting called to inform to degenerate into a “bull session” in which everyone has bright ideas. But a meeting called by him to stimulate thinking and ideas also does not become simply a presentation on the part of one of the members, but is run to challenge and stimulate everybody in the room. He always, at the end of his meetings, goes back to the opening statement and relates the final conclusions to the original intent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-effective-executive-focuses-on-contribution&quot;&gt;The Effective Executive Focuses on Contribution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective executive are always focusing on contribution that makes a positive impact on the company’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The man who focuses on efforts and who stresses his downward authority is a subordinate no matter how exalted his title and rank. But the man who focuses on contribution and who takes responsibility for results, no matter how junior, is in the most literal sense of the phrase, “top management.” He holds himself accountable for the performance of the whole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to achieve that, you can’t only look inward to what you want to do and what you think you can do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The focus on contribution turns the executive’s attention away from his own specialty, his own narrow skills, his own department, and toward the performance of the whole. It turns his attention to the outside, the only place where there are results. He is likely to have to think through what relationships his skills, his specialty, his function, or his department have to the entire organization and its purpose. He therefore will also come to think in terms of the customer, the client, or the patient, who is the ultimate reason for whatever the organization produces, whether it be economic goods, governmental policies, or health services. As a result, what he does and how he does it will be materially different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-areas-of-contribution&quot;&gt;Three Areas of Contribution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;direct results&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;value building and reaffirmation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;developing people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If deprived of performance in any one of these areas, it will decay and die. All three therefore have to be built into the contribution of every executive. But their relative importance varies greatly with the personality and the position of the executive as well as with the needs of the organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you focus on contribution, it will help you fulfill the four basic requirements of effective human relations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;communications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;teamwork&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;self-development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;development of others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping others be successful:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives find themselves asking other people in the organization, their superiors, their subordinates, but above all, their colleagues in other areas: ‘What contribution from me do you require to make your contribution to the organization? When do you need this, how do you need it, and in what form?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all, the biggest benefit of focusing on contribution is it counteracts chaos and highlights what’s important to spend time on versus what’s noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The focus on contribution imposes an organizing principle. It imposes relevance on events. Focusing on contribution turns one of the inherent weaknesses of the executive’s situation—his dependence on other people, his being within the organization—into a source of strength. It creates a team. Finally, focusing on contribution fights the temptation to stay within the organization. It leads the executive—especially the top-level man—to lift his eyes from the inside of efforts, work, and relationships, to the outside; that is, to the results of the organization. It makes him try hard to have direct contact with the outside—whether markets and customers, patients in a community, or the various “publics” which are the outside of a government agency. To focus on contribution is to focus on effectiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-strengths-productive&quot;&gt;Making Strengths Productive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drucker makes the argument that it’s best to build on strengths to achieve results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The effective executive fills positions and promotes on the basis of what a man can do. He does not make staffing decisions to minimize weaknesses but to maximize strength.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;staffing-for-strength&quot;&gt;Staffing for Strength&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two rules to staff for strengths:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look for strength in one major area. Ask, ‘what can this person do uncommonly well?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make each job demanding with a deep scope so their strengths can produce significant results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…every people-decision is a gamble. By basing it on what a man can do, it becomes at least a rational gamble.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spotting-team-members-not-using-their-strengths&quot;&gt;Spotting Team Members Not Using Their Strengths&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s your responsibility to spot and guide those on your team who aren’t making their strength’s productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The ones who are enthusiastic and who, in turn, have results to show for their work, are the ones whose abilities are being challenged and used. Those that are deeply frustrated all say, in one way or another: ‘My abilities are not being put to use.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s your job to know when this is happening, correct it, and be ahead of it so it’s unlikely to occur again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The assertion that “somebody else will not let me do anything” should always be suspected as a cover-up for inertia. But even where the situation does set limitations—and everyone lives and works within rather stringent limitations—there are usually important, meaningful, pertinent things that can be done. The effective executive looks for them. If he starts out with the question: “What can I do?” he is almost certain to find that he can actually do much more than he has time and resources for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-things-first&quot;&gt;First Things First&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effectiveness is reached by focusing on one thing at time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Concentration is necessary precisely because the executive faces so many tasks clamoring to be done. For doing one thing at a time means doing it fast. The more one can concentrate time, effort, and resources, the greater the number and diversity of tasks one can actually perform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you don’t focus on one thing at a time, you end up working harder and at the same time get nothing done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The people who get nothing done often work a great deal harder. In the first place, they underestimate the time for any one task. They always expect that everything will go right. Yet, as every executive knows, nothing ever goes right. The unexpected always happens—the unexpected is indeed the only thing one can confidently expect. And almost never is it a pleasant surprise. Effective executives therefore allow a fair margin of time beyond what is actually needed. In the second place, the typical (that is, the more or less ineffectual) executive tries to hurry—and that only puts him further behind. Effective executives do not race. They set an easy pace but keep going steadily. Finally, the typical executive tries to do several things at once. Therefore, he never has the minimum time quantum for any of the tasks in his program. If any one of them runs into trouble, his entire program collapses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always stay updated to the current programs, activities, and tasks. If something isn’t worth doing anymore, it’s better to stop it sooner than later and refocus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Systematic sloughing off of the old is the one and only way to force the new. There is no lack of ideas in any organization I know. “Creativity” is not our problem. But few organizations ever get going on their own good ideas. Everybody is much too busy on the tasks of yesterday. Putting all programs and activities regularly on trial for their lives and getting rid of those that cannot prove their productivity work wonders in stimulating creativity even in the most hidebound bureaucracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Concentration—that is, the courage to impose on time and events his own decision as to what really matters and comes first—is the executive’s only hope of becoming the master of time and events instead of their whipping boy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-elements-of-decision-making&quot;&gt;The Elements of Decision-Making&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drucker has a lot to say on decision making and how to do it effecively. I found these two sections way too long and verbose for my attention span. Although, I really like the below quote about how data-driven decisions should be seen as having a degree of risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Finding the appropriate measurement is thus not a mathematical exercise. It is a risk-taking judgment. Whenever one has to judge, one must have alternatives among which one can choose. A judgment in which one can only say “yes” or “no” is no judgment at all. Only if there are alternatives can one hope to get insight into what is truly at stake. Effective executives therefore insist on alternatives of measurement—so that they can choose the one appropriate one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generalist-vs-specialist&quot;&gt;Generalist vs specialist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The only meaningful definition of a “generalist” is a specialist who can relate his own small area to the universe of knowledge. Maybe a few people have knowledge in more than a few small areas. But that does not make them generalists; it makes them specialists in several areas. And one can be just as bigoted in three areas as in one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allowing-people-to-take-risks&quot;&gt;Allowing people to take risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Executives also owe it to the organization and to their fellow workers not to tolerate nonperforming individuals in important jobs. It may not be the employees’ fault that they are underperforming, but even so, they have to be removed. People who have failed in a new job should be given the choice to go back to a job at their former level and salary. This option is rarely exercised; such people, as a rule, leave voluntarily, at least when their employers are U.S. firms. But the very existence of the option can have a powerful effect, encouraging people to leave safe, comfortable jobs and take risky new assignments. The organization’s performance depends on employees’ willingness to take such chances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;developing-people&quot;&gt;Developing people&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“An executive’s focus on contribution by itself is a powerful force in developing people. People adjust to the level of the demands made on them. The executive who sets his sights on contribution raises the sights and standards of everyone with whom he works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…executives who take responsibility for contribution in their own work will as a rule demand that their subordinates take responsibility too. They will tend to ask their men: “What are the contributions for which this organization and I, your superior, should hold you accountable? What should we expect of you? What is the best utilization of your knowledge and your ability?” And then communication becomes possible, becomes indeed easy. Once the subordinate has thought through what contribution should be expected of him, the superior has, of course, both the right and the responsibility to judge the validity of the proposed contribution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A superior has responsibility for the work of others. He also has power over the careers of others. Making strengths productive is therefore much more than an essential of effectiveness. It is a moral imperative, a responsibility of authority and position. To focus on weakness is not only foolish; it is irresponsible. A superior owes it to his organization to make the strength of every one of his subordinates as productive as it can be. But even more does he owe it to the human beings over whom he exercises authority to help them get the most out of whatever strength they may have.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Released in July 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/&quot;&gt;Netlify Analytics&lt;/a&gt; is a new add-on to Netlify’s popular hosting and deployment platform. Starting at $9/month, it’s an “expensive” alternative to the analytics king, Google Analytics, which is free. But is it worth it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought it to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-good-about-netlify-analytics&quot;&gt;What is Good About Netlify Analytics?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netlify Analytics doesn’t slow down your website at all since you don’t need to add any code to your site. Installation was as easy as clicking a button in my Netlify backend. And since it’s anonymous and doesn’t use javascript or cookies, users with adblock are still counted and I didn’t need to add any cookie warnings on my site for GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-can-see-in-netlify-analytics&quot;&gt;What You Can See in Netlify Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pageviews&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;unique visitors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;top viewed pages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;top pages/resources not found&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;top sources/referrers (with path)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bandwidth used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-cant-you-see-in-netlify-analytics&quot;&gt;What Can’t You See in Netlify Analytics?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you can’t see beyond the last 30 days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can’t filter by page or change the date range&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can’t look at the top sources for an individual page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can’t see the bounce rate or average time on site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-netlify-analytics-worth-it&quot;&gt;Is Netlify Analytics Worth It?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Not right now. At $9/month for a product whose competitors are free and more capable, everyone was expecting more from this release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/netlify-analytics-pricing.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/netlify-analytics-pricing.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/netlify-analytics-pricing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Netlify Analytics starts at $9/month.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Netlify Analytics starts at $9/month.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You only have one “screen” without a single filter to segment your data.&lt;/strong&gt; Most egregious though is they delete data older than 30 days (or at least it’s not accessible). Second, I need to be able to break down referrer and pageviews by URL so I can see from where and how much traffic specific pages are getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is now, Netlify Analytics is a great product for people who have a simple curiosity for a site or project’s stats. And if you really care about shaving milliseconds off load times or capturing ad block users, Netlify Analytics could be for you. But if you just casually need analytics, are you going to pay $9/month for it? I’m not sure it’s worth it, but many people are happy to give Netlify $9/month for Analytics because their free hosting and deployment platform is so good that they just want to support them. It’s not all bad news for Netlify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But remember, this is version one of Netlify Analytics. If Netlify can improve the product by adding the above features, it very well could be a game changer - something I’m eagerly anticipating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alternatives-to-netlify-analytics&quot;&gt;Alternatives to Netlify Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/&quot;&gt;Fathom Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://simpleanalytics.com/&quot;&gt;Simple Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although both Fathom and Simple Analytics are not server-side analytics, they are both GDPR compliant and focused on user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just signed up for Fathom and will do a review soon to see how it compares to Netlify Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Reggie Paquette</name></author><category term="[&quot;all&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Netlify Analytics is a server side analytics tool that doesn’t slow down your website, protects the privacy of your users, and is GDPR compliant.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/netlify-analytics.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/netlify-analytics.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Grew Organic Inbound Monthly Recurring Revenue with SEO by 130%</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/servicetitan-seo-case-study" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Grew Organic Inbound Monthly Recurring Revenue with SEO by 130%" /><published>2019-07-23T19:37:27-07:00</published><updated>2019-07-23T19:37:27-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/servicetitan-seo-case-study</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/servicetitan-seo-case-study">&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, most of our customers acquired from marketing efforts were from paid channels. My goal was to increase leads and revenue generated with content and SEO. Our website was very thin on content and most of our visitors were from branded search queries. We weren’t generating any new demand. &lt;strong&gt;We were only capturing existing demand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below was our very simple website structure. My challenge was to build and expand on this content in order to rank for more bottom-of-funnel (BOFU) search queries and therefore generate more leads without increasing marketing spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--full gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/servicetitan-seo-1.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-seo-1.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-seo-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Original ServiceTitan sitemap.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Original ServiceTitan sitemap.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To generate more leads and new customer organically, my solution was to create more BOFU content to rank for more BOFU search queries. Rather than prioritizing top-of-funnel (TOFU) such as blog posts on wider industry related topics, I prioritized creating content and ranking for buyer-centric search queries. Although these search queries are generally harder to rank for, it would quickly and directly lead to more leads and new customers. Below is the process my team and I used to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-icreating-new-pages&quot;&gt;Part I — Creating New Pages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1keyword-research&quot;&gt;Step 1 — Keyword Research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we started planning the new pages to create, we first needed data. This is where keyword research came in. We started with Google Search Console (GSC) and uncovered the non-brand keywords/queries people were already using to find our site. Since Google Ads was already a consistent channel, we also looked at our top performing non-brand queries. Then, we looked at the main pages our competitors created and the queries they were going after. After gathering a list of potential queries, we prioritized them based on simple criteria: search volume, stage in funnel, and relatedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2plan-new-sitemap&quot;&gt;Step 2 — Plan New Sitemap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we knew what queries to go after, we planned what pages to create and where they would fit on our site. Here’s the new sitemap we came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/servicetitan-seo-2.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-seo-2.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-seo-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;New ServiceTitan sitemap.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;New ServiceTitan sitemap.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Product Tour would expand from a single page to nine pages. An all new section for the Industries we serve allowed us to create four more pages to go after more target queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3getting-the-team-onboard&quot;&gt;Step 3 — Getting the Team Onboard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating 13 new pages is not a simple task. We needed many people involved to make sure the pages were more than just new content for SEO. They needed to correctly and thoroughly explain the product. They needed to entice the reader with good copy. They needed to be designed well and reflect our brand appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled in our Head of Creative to discuss the scope of the project. He led the designers and developers and we pulled in the Product Marketing team to create the initial copy. Our SEO Specialist on my team reviewed the copy and made sure we were optimizing for our target queries and had enough content. He also wrote the new page URLs and meta data for each page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4publishing-the-pages&quot;&gt;Step 4 — Publishing the Pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first published the Industry pages, because they had the highest ROI potential and were quicker to create. Here’s what they looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-3&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/servicetitan-hvac-software.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-hvac-software.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;

        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/servicetitan-electrical-software.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-electrical-software.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-electrical-software.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Click here to view the live pages. Note: Design on live pages may have changed since the publishing of this case study.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/servicetitan-plumbing-software.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-plumbing-software.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-plumbing-software.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Click here to view the live pages. Note: Design on live pages may have changed since the publishing of this case study.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.servicetitan.com/hvac-software&quot;&gt;Click here to view the live pages. Note: Design on live pages may have changed since the publishing of this case study.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after much revisions and improvements, we published the new Product Tour. The old, single page Product Tour looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--full gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/servicetitan-old-product-tour.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-old-product-tour.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-old-product-tour.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Click here to view the live page. Note: Page may have been deleted since the publishing of this case study.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.servicetitan.com/solutions&quot;&gt;Click here to view the live page. Note: Page may have been deleted since the publishing of this case study.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had only one section for each major function of the product. From a brand and web experience point-of-view, it would not be beneficial to the user to only expand on the functions that had opportunity in search. Therefore we expanded on all the main product functions into their own pages. And here’s what they looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-3&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/servicetitan-dispatch-software.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-dispatch-software.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-dispatch-software.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/servicetitan-scheduling-software.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-scheduling-software.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-scheduling-software.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/servicetitan-call-booking-software.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-call-booking-software.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-call-booking-software.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-iionsite-seo&quot;&gt;Part II — Onsite SEO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we published the pages, I directed our SEO Specialist to fine tune each page for better rankings. This included the meta title and description, the heading tags on the page, the keyword density, and proper schema and HTML markup. To increase our click-through-rate (CTR) in the search engine result pages (SERPs), we used the review schema:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--full gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/servicetitan-schema.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-schema.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-schema.png&quot; alt=&quot;Review data used from Capterra.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.capterra.com/p/150053/ServiceTitan/&quot;&gt;Review data used from Capterra.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then to let Google know these new pages are important, we added a new section on our homepage to spread some “link juice” to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--full gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/servicetitan-homepage.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-homepage.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-homepage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Links on the homepage to the new Industry pages.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.servicetitan.com/&quot;&gt;Links on the homepage to the new Industry pages.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we went through our best blog posts and added internal links to our new Industry and Product Tour pages where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-iiilinkbuilding&quot;&gt;Part III — Linkbuilding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we were already doing regular press releases, we sprinkled in some links to our new pages. Second, we hired a linkbuilding agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of marketers will say this is not a smart move, but here’s how we made it work. The links being built had to be through content. That content had to actually be good. The sites we submitted content to did not sell guest posts or allow self submissions — we had to work with them. The sites had to be related to our industry or tech. They most definitely can’t be in a private blog network (PBN). With these standards in place, we found an agency who could do this for us. They acted more like a PR firm than a linkbuilding agency and that’s exactly what we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We published the Industry pages in early Q2 of 2018 and the new Product Tour in Q3. For each Industry page’s primary keyword, we achieved a rank of either #3 or #2 in the SERPs. While the new Product Tour’s rankings are still improving, the primary query for those pages have less volume and are less lucrative. Every week we exported a search performance report from GSC. Using REGEXMATCH formulas in Google Sheets, we bucketed queries into segments to track performance in the SERPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/servicetitan-serp-performance.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-serp-performance.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-serp-performance.png&quot; alt=&quot;Growth of impressions and clicks from Google Search Console.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Growth of impressions and clicks from Google Search Console.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-brand BOFU organic clicks grew 260% by the beginning of Q4 ‘18 compared to the average month in Q1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To attribute down funnel metrics to organic search, we used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizible.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bizible&lt;/a&gt;. With Bizible’s integration into Salesforce, we could see all the booked meetings, pipeline, and revenue generated from organic search and which page they started their session on. And because we knew which pages were ranking for which queries, we could infer how much revenue a segment of search queries were generating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--full gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/servicetitan-seo-results.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/servicetitan-seo-results.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Growth of attributable pipeline and revenue from organic search in 2018.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New customer monthly recurring revenue from organic search grew 130% by the beginning of Q4 ‘18 compared to the average month in Q1. As more links are built and more content added over time, the rankings, leads, and customers generated will continue to improve.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Reggie Paquette</name></author><summary type="html">Problem</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images//servicetitan-seo-1.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images//servicetitan-seo-1.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Blogging on Medium vs Self Hosted Blog</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blogging-on-medium-vs-self-hosted-blog" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Blogging on Medium vs Self Hosted Blog" /><published>2019-07-19T11:02:48-07:00</published><updated>2019-07-19T11:02:48-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blogging-on-medium-vs-self-hosted-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blogging-on-medium-vs-self-hosted-blog">&lt;p&gt;Most people stop blogging on Medium because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t “own” your traffic because your blog is on medium.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have less control of converting traffic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medium promotes other peoples’ articles on your own articles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More readers are dedicated to Medium than dedicated to you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the switch wasn’t about the “building a house on rented land” aspect. I was early to Medium publications so I could use my custom domain (regpaq.com) on Medium. Thankfully I got in before they removed this feature so I shouldn’t lose any rankings since I’m still on the same domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what made me want to stop blogging on Medium? The stats.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium’s stats are broken and very limited. I want to be able to see three things for a given period of my choosing. How much is my traffic growing? What’s the distribution of traffic between pages? Where is that traffic coming from? This isn’t possible on Medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problems-with-medium-stats&quot;&gt;The Problems with Medium Stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one huge problem with Medium stats. &lt;strong&gt;They include views of your comments on other people’s articles in your view count!&lt;/strong&gt; And there is no way to filter them out. So no, you can’t see how many total views just your articles received over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/medium-stats.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/medium-stats.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/medium-stats.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My last 30 days blogging on Medium for all articles... and comments.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;My last 30 days blogging on Medium for all articles... and comments.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other major problem is you can only view your traffic in 30 day windows.&lt;/strong&gt; If you got a lot of views one day, you can’t look at just that day’s traffic and see what pages got the most views or where that traffic came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above the graph, Medium suggests you can click a story to see stats for just that story. Unfortunately, when you click on a story it loads a new page and takes five seconds to load. &lt;strong&gt;So you have to click each individual story one by one to uncover which story went “viral” and racked up the most views on a big traffic day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--full gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/medium-referrers.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/medium-referrers.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/medium-referrers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Limited referrer data for a blog post on Medium.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Limited referrer data for a blog post on Medium.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside an individual story’s stats, you can see the list of referrers. But only the domain.&lt;/strong&gt; In the above example, I can’t see which Reddit threads are talking about my article! Which means I can’t see what people are saying and jump in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started blogging on Medium, I knew the stats were limited, but I didn’t know by how much. The reason I moved to Medium in the first place was because I wanted simplicity. I wanted simple metrics. I didn’t want to fiddle with the design. I didn’t want to mess with plugins. I wanted a better editor than WordPress. I just wanted to write. But now things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;limited-customization-on-medium&quot;&gt;Limited Customization on Medium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest pros of blogging on Medium is that the design is all done for you. You don’t have to worry about it. It’s always better to write and publish more than to fiddle with the design. What changed for me was a massive increase in interest in learning HTML and CSS. &lt;strong&gt;By moving off of Medium, my blog is now a showcase for my design and dev skills.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I didn’t go back to WordPress and instead used &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator. It was a much bigger process than I anticipated. I designed the site in Adobe XD then developed it. &lt;strong&gt;The end result is a blog I designed and I developed with articles I wrote and I illustrated. It’s a culmination of many of my skills in a single project.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;static-sites-are-fast&quot;&gt;Static Sites are Fast&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit to a static site is the speed. Because WordPress and Medium use a database, it loads much slower. Here is the Pingdom page speed and Google score comparison of the same article on Medium versus the current static site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/medium-pingdom-old.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/medium-pingdom-old.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;

        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/medium-google-old.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/medium-google-old.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;

        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Medium article page speed score from Google.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/medium-pingdom-new.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/medium-pingdom-new.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/medium-pingdom-new.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Static article page speed from Pingdom.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Static article page speed from Pingdom.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/medium-google-new.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/medium-google-new.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/medium-google-new.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Static article page speed score from Google.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Static article page speed score from Google.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The static site is a massive improvement for speed&lt;/strong&gt; - even without any image optimization. This should improve the bounce rate and thus increase organic rankings. But because people know what to expect when they land on a Medium-designed article, it’s possible the new design increases the bounce rate. I’ll never know for certain because you can’t measure the bounce rate on Medium. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one catch here about the speed of my site. I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;/netlify-analytics-review&quot;&gt;Netlify’s new Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, which is a server side analytics solution. It measures at the server level so it’s not adding an extra request to the page, like Google Analytics would. The problem is Netlify’s Analytics is even worse than Medium’s so I’ll be switching to Google Analytics or Clicky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;rec-art&quot; aria-label=&quot;Recommended Article&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/netlify-analytics-review&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;        
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-ill-miss-about-blogging-on-medium&quot;&gt;What I’ll Miss About Blogging on Medium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium’s coolest social feature is “claps.” If people like your article, they can clap for it up to 50 times. It’s nice to get and give claps, but it does have a downside. Medium syndicates and recommends articles to other users based on how many claps it gets. &lt;strong&gt;This made me too focused on claps. I even joined three Facebook groups where people just clap for each others’ articles. It’s a stupid game.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll also miss comments until I can figure out a solution. Because static sites don’t have databases, comments are difficult to add. I don’t want to use something like Disqus, which increases load time and prevents me from “owning” the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I won’t miss Medium’s distribution. I never got any meaningful distribution. I could have written more content for more claps, but I didn’t want to play that game.&lt;/strong&gt; I want to write what I want to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now onto finding which analytics tool I’m going to use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Reggie Paquette</name></author><category term="[&quot;all&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Most people stop blogging on Medium because:</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/medium-vs-self-hosted-blog.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/medium-vs-self-hosted-blog.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Grew Cold Outbound Booked Meetings by 49%</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/helped-increase-cold-outbound-booked-meetings-by-49-in-q1-19-over-q4-18" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Grew Cold Outbound Booked Meetings by 49%" /><published>2019-06-10T19:37:27-07:00</published><updated>2019-06-10T19:37:27-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/helped-increase-cold-outbound-booked-meetings-by-49-in-q1-19-over-q4-18</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/helped-increase-cold-outbound-booked-meetings-by-49-in-q1-19-over-q4-18">&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I joined Chili Piper, we had just one full cycle account executive (AE) on the sales team and the plan was to hire eight more in seven months. The challenge was to (1) develop instrumentation to determine what part of our outreach was working, (2) reliably scale it to other sales reps as they joined the team, and (3) improve the conversion rate of accounts worked to meetings booked so we wouldn’t burn through our target accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1build-instrumentation-to-measure-cadence-performance&quot;&gt;Step 1 — Build Instrumentation to Measure Cadence Performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we were using SalesLoft and it integrates with Salesforce (SFDC), I was able to build automated dashboards that tracked over 140 different metrics for each cadence. Read about how I did this &lt;a href=&quot;/automating-salesloft-cadence-metrics-into-google-sheets&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Now I could look at our cold outbound performance and see exactly which meetings were booked from what cadences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2figure-out-whatworks&quot;&gt;Step 2 — Figure Out What Works&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;measure-content-and-messaging&quot;&gt;Measure content and messaging&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the instrumentation in place, I started making new cadences and adding keywords to our email step names which we could use to break out performance. For example, we started with persuasion factors (liking, consistency, social proof, etc). Then I started adding keywords for content that we’d include — a certain GIF, an image, etc. From this, I determined what type of approach worked best and what content was most effective at getting our value across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;optimize-strategy-and-approach-to-target-accounts&quot;&gt;Optimize strategy and approach to target accounts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I looked at our strategy of which accounts to target. We previously were just working accounts our AE had found on online lists like the Cloud 100. Because we had Clearbit Enrichment, I wanted to use some of the data it provided on accounts we had in SFDC. First, I made a list of target accounts that were using Drift. The logic here was that if they were using Drift, they have already bought into the idea that they need to empower their buyers and make it easier for them to connect with sales (which aligned very closely with Chili Piper). I wrote a cadence piggybacking on this belief and positioned our product as an additional way to make it easier for their buyers to connect with them. I did the same for target accounts using intercom and we saw a 71% increase in the rate of accounts worked to meetings booked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In attempt to replicate this strategy, I wrote a cadence targeting accounts who had a conversion rate optimization tool (VWO, Optimizely, etc). This time, I piggybacked on the idea that if they care about their conversion rate on their website and landing pages, they should also care about the conversion rate after the form submission to a closed deal. As expected, this didn’t perform as well as piggybacking off a chat tool, but still better than our original cadence by 22%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;customize-cadences-to-the-account&quot;&gt;Customize cadences to the account&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with these types of cadences were we couldn’t scale them, but they remained in our back pocket when we could use them. For accounts that weren’t using either of these identified tools, we needed a different approach. Since we were signing new accounts who are vertical leaders, we customized which customers we name dropped as social proof by aligning them as much as possible to the prospect’s industry. Additionally, I had our reps take a screenshot of the prospect’s lead/demo form to put in the first email. This account personalized cadence was a huge 107% improvement over our original cadence and we scaled this to rest of the team and our new hires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a team, we were able to increase productivity and efficiency that resulted in a 49% increase in cold outbound booked meetings in Q1 ’19 compared to Q4 ’18 and a 118% jump in pipeline generated. We were trending to improve booked meetings in Q2 ’19 by another 18% and pipeline by 9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a &lt;a href=&quot;/created-a-forecast-model-to-double-customer-acquisition-growth&quot;&gt;goal to double new business monthly revenue&lt;/a&gt; in less than 12 months and it was going to take massive effort from both our cold prospecting and demand gen efforts. Additionally, we wanted to increase market awareness of our flagship product, Concierge, which allowed qualified leads to schedule their own sales meeting while filling out a demo request form — a step toward being more self-serve for B2B companies that require prospects to go through sales to become a customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1refresh-linkedinads&quot;&gt;Step 1 — Refresh LinkedIn Ads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started LinkedIn ads with great success in the last two quarters of 2018, but we began to experience some audience decay as costs-per-click and costs-per-booked meeting started to rise dramatically. What was once a fresh product for a new audience became a stale product for an audience who’s seen our ads and product several dozen times — if they didn’t convert already, we would need to do something different to convert them now. Here’s the type of ads we had ran when first starting LinkedIn Ads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/chili-inbound-1.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-inbound-1.jpeg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-inbound-1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Old Chili Piper LinkedIn ads that worked when first starting the channel.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Old Chili Piper LinkedIn ads that worked when first starting the channel.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we were spending ~$10k+ on LinkedIn to reach our audience every month, I decided our next move was to run more visually engaging ads that showed and explained the product so even if people didn’t click through, they could see what our product had to offer. The “secret weapon” would now be revealed into their news feeds, which also made impressions much more valuable. Here’s what they looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/chili-inbound-2.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-inbound-2.jpeg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-inbound-2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;New image ads.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;New image ads.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/chili-inbound-3.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-inbound-3.jpeg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-inbound-3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;New LinkedIn carousel ad to increase engagement and show how Concierge works.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;New LinkedIn carousel ad to increase engagement and show how Concierge works.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--full gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-inbound-4.gif&quot; type=&quot;image/gif&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-inbound-4.gif&quot; alt=&quot;New video ad.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;New video ad.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I tested video ads showing how it works right on the landing page this ad led to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested several different messaging to each of our main personas and kept a log of what type of messaging (e.g. pain points, value benefits) resonated with our different personas the best. The plan was to take these learnings and apply them to all of our marketing and messaging across our teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2new-landingpages&quot;&gt;Step 2 — New Landing Pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to increasing the value of ad impressions on LinkedIn, I also overhauled our landing page with improved copy, branding, and design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/chili-inbound-5.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-inbound-5.jpeg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-inbound-5.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Old landing page on the left; new on the right.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Old landing page on the left; new on the right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new landing page converted 84% better (4.94% vs 2.68%) than the old one. A big reason for this improvement was the new ads were sending less clicks than the old ads, but the traffic was higher quality because the new ads showed what the product was about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3launch-google-ads-search-and-retargeting&quot;&gt;Step 3 — Launch Google Ads Search and Retargeting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until this point, we never had invested a lot of resources into developing our Google Ads program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;search-campaigns&quot;&gt;Search Campaigns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with 3 core search campaigns: competitors, non-brand, and brand. The competitors campaign bid on several queries like “{alternatives, competitors, similar to, like} [competitor name]”. To grab the attention of our target market, we made sure to include “B2B” in our ad copy at least once in every ad. The non-brand campaign consisted of targeting search queries around “scheduling for B2B” or “scheduling for sales.” In the brand campaign, we bid on keywords that included our brand name, but which we weren’t ranking #1 in Google for, such as “Chili Piper Reviews”, “Chili Piper plugin”, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;retargeting-campaigns&quot;&gt;Retargeting Campaigns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I set up a retargeting campaign to all website visitors, including those who visited our landing pages from LinkedIn and AdWords. The ads looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/chili-inbound-6.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-inbound-6.jpeg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-inbound-6.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;New Chili Piper Google retargeting ads.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;New Chili Piper Google retargeting ads.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now anyone who visited our website or our landing pages and didn’t convert would see our product, branding, and main value prop. Anyone who visited our website and is in the sales process with an account executive would see these ads, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closed-won revenue from inbound demo requests jumped 155% in April and May ’19 compared to all of Q1. Using an average of April and May’19 for a simple June forecast, revenue growth will increase to 282%.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Reggie Paquette</name></author><summary type="html">Problem</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/chili-inbound-2.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/chili-inbound-2.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Built Forecast Model to Double Customer Acquisition</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/created-a-forecast-model-to-double-customer-acquisition-growth" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Built Forecast Model to Double Customer Acquisition" /><published>2019-06-09T11:01:47-07:00</published><updated>2019-06-09T11:01:47-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/created-a-forecast-model-to-double-customer-acquisition-growth</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/created-a-forecast-model-to-double-customer-acquisition-growth">&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a goal to double new business monthly revenue, but not a clear path or timeline to get there. We were only looking in the rear view mirror and monthly reviews ended with us saying, “we did well, but we need to get to x (somehow).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without clear targets for each team and individual in the customer acquisition org, we couldn’t motivate the team, forecast growth, or determine which channels and initiatives to prioritize to hit our target in the shortest amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at the previous 12 month performance by major customer acquisition (CA) function (Outbound, Events, Paid Inbound, and Earned Inbound), we could find the best opportunities for growth while giving clear targets to each team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, it’s essential to have reliable data. Since I previously built a &lt;a href=&quot;/automating-new-business-revenue-reporting-into-google-sheets&quot;&gt;Revenue Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; that detailed our funnel metrics by major CA function already, I could begin to do some estimations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wrong way to forecast is to start with saying “Okay, we need to get to x in 12 months. What do we need to do to get there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‘ve learned to to start with from the bottom up by identifying the inputs and levers that are in your control and what the results could be if you increased those inputs and pulled those levers over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1start-with-previousresults&quot;&gt;Step 1 — Start With Previous Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a new spreadsheet, I started with previous data broken down by the major CA functions I wanted to forecast by: Outbound, Events, Paid Inbound, Earned Inbound, and a total that rolls up all four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2define-your-inputs-and-levers-for-eachfunction&quot;&gt;Step 2 — Define Your Inputs and Levers for Each Function&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different functions will have different inputs and levers and you’ll have to determine what those are. Here’s what I went with at Chili Piper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;outbound&quot;&gt;Outbound&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inputs for cold Outbound were the (1) number of sales development reps (SDRs) and full-cycle account executives (AEs) and (2) the number of booked meetings we could reasonably expect each rep to book at full efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I knew how many reps we needed to hit a particular Outbound meeting goal and closed won revenue goal. Then we added an estimated ramp period and figured out what was possible with cold Outbound based on when and how many people we could afford to hire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/chili-forecast-1.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-1.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cold outbound hiring plan and forecast.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Cold outbound hiring plan and forecast.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold Outbound hiring plan and booked meeting forecast to hit goal in December ‘19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I knew what we could expect in Outbound meetings per month based on the number of each type of sales reps we had and if they were running at full efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next was to look at the levers, which I concluded to be (1) our conversion rates of each part of the funnel and (2) our average customer value (ACV).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/chili-forecast-2.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-2.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Levers can be adjusted for a ground up forecast.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Levers can be adjusted for a ground up forecast.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue numbers are the levers. By pulling these levers, we could improve efficiency over time. Number of Goal Booked Meetings roll up from the inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why conversion rates and ACV? It’s what our sales team has most control of. For example, in April, I estimated our team would convert 75% of Outbound booked meetings into opportunities. The SDR is in control of setting qualified meetings and in control of the cadence and messaging to increase likelihood the prospect will attend the meeting. Next was estimating improvement in opportunity to closed-won conversion rates. It’s 16% in April and grows to 20% by June. We estimated this 25% improvement in just two months because we had already recognized this as an opportunity for improvement and implemented weekly training and call coaching to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Chili Piper’s product can be used by many different teams at a company and we have a variety of products, it’s difficult to estimate the potential value of an account. In the past, AEs have closed good-size companies in just a $300 deal (one product and one license), and other times deal sizes can be several thousand dollars when selling multiple products and many licenses up front. With training again, we were able to improve the ACV and expected it to continue to grow as skills improve and as we release more products throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;events&quot;&gt;Events&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing my methodology for Events, the inputs are (1) the number of events and (2) the number of expected meetings from each event. Working with our Events Manager, we were able to roughly plan out the rest of the year and set meeting goals for each event and attending sales rep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/chili-forecast-3.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-3.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Event booked meeting goals by sales rep. Meetings booked by “Other” are from non Sales team members.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Event booked meeting goals by sales rep. Meetings booked by “Other” are from non Sales team members.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The levers for Events are the same as Outbound, conversion rates and ACV; however, we didn’t forecast any change here since we already converted well from events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/chili-forecast-4.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-4.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Number of Goal Booked Meetings roll up from the inputs.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Number of Goal Booked Meetings roll up from the inputs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;paid-inbound&quot;&gt;Paid Inbound&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forecasting and goal setting for Paid Inbound is a bit tricky because the only true input fully in my control is spend, however with limited historical data, spend and cost-per-lead (CPL) by channel wasn’t the best place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, my inputs were the number of leads I could reasonably expect from each of the channels we’re currently using and plan to use in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/chili-forecast-5.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-5.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Inbound lead goal by channel for Paid Inbound.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Inbound lead goal by channel for Paid Inbound.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The levers for Inbound include conversion rates and ACV, but start with Leads and two additional conversion stages: Lead &amp;gt; Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL) and MQL to Booked Meeting (BM). For spend, I estimated the average total CPL and therefore determined the budget required for paid acquisition for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/chili-forecast-6.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-6.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Paid forecast broken down by channel.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Paid forecast broken down by channel.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we didn’t have historical Paid &amp;amp; Earned Inbound metrics until May, Paid Inbound forecasts start in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;earned-inbound&quot;&gt;Earned Inbound&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earned Inbound is even more trickier than Paid. For the most part, Earned Inbound is out of my direct control. Results come from a combination of activities done throughout the company. And since we didn’t have a marketing automation platform set up, we couldn’t yet determine the source of non paid leads, which could either be direct, organic, or referral. So unfortunately, there was much more guess work here and I simply estimated a growth in leads over time and the levers being the same as Paid Inbound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/chili-forecast-7.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-7.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Estimated growth in Earned (non paid) leads over time.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Estimated growth in Earned (non paid) leads over time.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3making-thisuseful&quot;&gt;Step 3 — Making This Useful&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each function’s goals had two tables below: (1) an auto updating “Actuals” table and (2) a table comparing the differences from Goal to Actual to visually see where we hit and missed goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/chili-forecast-8.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-8.jpeg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-8.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Everything rolls up for a total customer acquisition forecast.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Everything rolls up for a total customer acquisition forecast.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having all this data in one place was great for the leadership team to get a pulse check on all the teams in CA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then because I built dashboards for &lt;a href=&quot;/automating-new-business-revenue-reporting-into-google-sheets&quot;&gt;New Business Revenue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/building-the-marketing-dashboard&quot;&gt;Marketing&lt;/a&gt;, and Outbound Sales, I could put an auto updating Trend and Goal column where each team could see what they were currently trending to as a team and individually and how that compared to the month’s Goal. This made it easy to see at any point during the month where we had to step up in order to hit goal. Here’s an example of what that looked like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--full gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/chili-forecast-9.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-9.jpeg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/chili-forecast-9.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Forecast and goals by channel were added to each channel's dashboards.&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Forecast and goals by channel were added to each channel's dashboards.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;
