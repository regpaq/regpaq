<p>I received an inheritance of $30k. <strong>One year later, I had blown it all.</strong></p>

<p>I used the money to move out, get a new car, eat out constantly — all while telling myself I’m going to be making $10k a month before I know it as freelance marketer.</p>

<p><strong>Every month I knew I was spending more than I was making, but I was too scared to look at my bank account or my credit card statement. *Just click pay*</strong></p>

<p>It wasn’t until I could only afford one more month’s rent that I accepted I needed a full-time job and a budget.</p>

<p>It’s been five years since then and I’ve learned a few tricks along the way. The most important thing is to <strong>understand the difference between a good budget system and a bad one.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A bad budget system only shows you where your money is going. A good budget system will create a change in your behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-my-google-sheets-budget-template-can-improve-your-spending-habits">How My Google Sheets Budget Template Can Improve Your Spending Habits</h2>

<p>Most importantly, it forces you to enter your expenses <strong>manually</strong>. Although this seems crazy with today’s tools that can link to your accounts and do this automatically, <strong>doing it manually is crucial to improving spending habits.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Manually recording your expenses every week will force you to review every transaction, to feel the pain of every dollar spent, and make you think “was that really necessary?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another reason to manually record expenses is you can fine-tune the expense category for each transaction, or even split a transaction into two categories.</p>

<p>This gives you way more options for using and tailoring categories exactly to your needs.</p>

<p>For example, here’s one of my favorite charts where you can see how you’ve been spending vs your budget by each category over time.</p>

<figure class="figure no-dark-filter figure--full gtc-1">
    <div><img class="image" src="/assets/images/budget2.gif" alt="Graphs for each budget category." /></div><figcaption class="caption">Graphs for each budget category.</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="view-and-start-using-my-google-sheets-budgettemplate">View and Start Using My Google Sheets Budget Template</h2>

<p>Open the link below and click ‘make a copy’ to start using it in your Google Drive.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VRczmKEyg96fFixxz4LtR-1Yh2_V4xILIGVrpRqN38w/copy" target="_blank">Download: My Google Sheets Budget Template</a></p>

<p>I highly recommend reading on to learn how to set the budget template up for your finances and learn how to use it.</p>

<p>Besides the initial set up and ongoing expense recording, <strong>everything is automated.</strong></p>

<h2 id="instructions-how-to-use-the-budget-template">Instructions: How to Use The Budget Template</h2>

<p>I included easy-to-follow prompts to make it simple and quick to get set up.</p>

<figure class="figure no-dark-filter figure--middle gtc-1">
    <div><img class="image" src="assets/images/budget1.gif" alt="Prompts make it super easy to use this Google Sheets template." /></div><figcaption class="caption">Prompts make it super easy to use this Google Sheets template.</figcaption></figure>

<p>You can learn how to use the template in this video tutorial, or by reading the below guide if you prefer.</p>

<h3 id="i-enter-your-income">I. Enter your income</h3>

<p>In the top left box on the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab, enter your income. Follow the orange colored cells as cues for which part to fill out. If you don’t have a <strong>401k</strong> or a <strong>Recurring Income #2</strong> (additional income), you can leave those sections blank.</p>

<figure class="figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1">
    <div><img class="image" src="/assets/images/budget3.png" alt="Enter your income data in the Income box on the Dashbord tab" /></div><figcaption class="caption">Enter your income data in the Income box on the Dashbord tab</figcaption></figure>

<p>Any income entered here will be added to your available budget. If you do receive any kind of extra income, you may either be putting it all in savings, part of it in savings, or you need all of it for your expenses. Unless you’re comfortable with Google Sheets and spreadsheet formulas, this budget template is only made for two sources of income. If you have more than one additional income source, you can sum them and enter the total as one number in the <strong>Recurring Income #2</strong> cell.</p>

<p>If you need all or a portion of that extra income, you need to add it to the <strong>Recurring Income #2</strong> cell. If you save all of it, you can still add it if you wish (and offset it later by increasing how much of your income is sent to savings) or you can omit it.</p>

<p>Once this section is completed, you’ll get your <strong>Net Total Income</strong>, which is how much net income you have left over to spend, put in savings etc.</p>

<h3 id="ii-enter-monthly-recurring-expenses">II. Enter Monthly Recurring Expenses</h3>

<p>Below the <strong>Income</strong> box is the <strong>Monthly Recurring</strong> box.</p>

<figure class="figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1">
    <div><img class="image" src="/assets/images/budget4.png" alt="Enter your monthly recurring expenses on the Dashbord tab" /></div><figcaption class="caption">Enter your monthly recurring expenses on the Dashbord tab</figcaption></figure>

<p>The first item is <strong>Savings</strong> to help you prioritize setting money aside for savings to help you “pay yourself first”, a very effecitve wealth building strategy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The goal [of pay yourself first] is to make sure that enough income is first saved or invested before monthly expenses or discretionary purchases are made.”</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payyourselffirst.asp" target="_blank">Investopedia</a></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you can start adding recurring monthly expenses. These are monthly expenditures that are typically the same amount every month. Examples include rent and utilities, car payment and insurance, phone bills, gym memberships, Netflix/Spotify, etc.</p>

<p>After this, you’ll be left with your <strong>Net Spendable Income</strong>, which tells you how much you have left for discretionary spending for food, shopping, going out, and other expenses. But first, there’s one more step before we get to creating our actual budget: annual expenses.</p>

<h3 id="iii-enter-annual-expenses">III. Enter Annual Expenses</h3>

<p>The strategy behind including annual expenses is to set aside a monthly amount of money to prepare for when these big expenses come up. Start by adding in things you pay once a year for in the <strong>Annual Recurring</strong> box. Some examples are car registration, vacations, gifts, car maintenance, credit card annualy fees, Amazon Prime, etc.</p>

<figure class="figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1">
    <div><img class="image" src="/assets/images/budget5.png" alt="Enter your annually recurring expenses on the Dashbord tab" /></div><figcaption class="caption">Enter your annually recurring expenses on the Dashbord tab</figcaption></figure>

<p>After you entered in all the annual expenses you can think of, the budget template will divide the total into a monthly amount as a line item back in the <strong>Monthly Recurring</strong> box. Now you have your final <strong>Net Spendable Income</strong> amount you can use to start budgeting.</p>

<h3 id="iv-create-your-budget">IV. Create Your Budget</h3>

<p>Now that you know how much money you can comfortably spend after savings, monthly recurring expenses, and planning for future annual expenses, you can create your budget. In the <strong>Monthly Budget</strong> box, enter categories of expenses and an allotted amount. Some examples include eating out, groceries, going out, shopping, coffee, alcohol, personal care, gas, etc.</p>

<figure class="figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1">
    <div><img class="image" src="/assets/images/budget6.png" alt="Enter the spending categories you want to track and their budget on the Dashbord tab" /></div><figcaption class="caption">Enter the spending categories you want to track and their budget on the Dashbord tab</figcaption></figure>

<p>Thanks to some clever conditional formatting in Google Sheets, the budget template will sum your <strong>Total</strong> monthly expenses. If the <strong>Total</strong> is green, your expenses are under your <strong>Net Spendable Income</strong>. It will be red if it’s over and you will need to readjust your <strong>Monthly Budget</strong> or consider eliminating or reducing some of your monthly or annual recurring expenses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Before we can get into the <strong>Summary</strong>, <strong>Spent vs Budget</strong>, and <strong>Expenses Last 7 Months</strong> boxes, we need to run through the other tabs in the Google Sheet budget template first.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="v-recording-expenses">V. Recording Expenses</h3>

<p>One of the presumably biggest downsides of a doing your personal budget in Google Sheets is that you have to enter your expenses in manually, but this is a blessing in disguise. Entering your expenses manually will have a big psychological effect on you to spend less. It forces you to “feel the pain” of every dollar you spend.</p>

<p>So on the <strong>Expenses</strong> tab you’ll enter each of your expenses - one row per one expense.</p>

<p>You’ll see some instructions in red at the top for more information. Across the blue row heading, the budget template auto populates your <strong>Monthly Expenses</strong> categories from the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab. When you enter an expense, start with the date in <strong>Column A</strong>, the name of the place you spend the money in <strong>Column B</strong>, and then tab over to the column with the expense category that best matches how this expense should be categorized. If it’s an annual expense, it’s the same exact process - just make sure you’re in the right annual expense column.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: It’s important you don’t change the order of your items in the <strong>Monthly Expenses</strong> box on the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab because the column you entered the expense under isn’t locked to the expense category.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are the expense categories in different columns instead of writing in/choosing the expense category in a single category column? For two reasons. One, it’s much faster to just ‘tab’ over to the right expense category column than writing it in or switching from keyboard to mouse to choose the right category from a dropdown. Second, it allows for less process-heavy formulas making the spreadsheet more smooth to use.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: When choosing the date, it doesn’t matter whether you choose the transaction date or the posted date (if pulling from a credit card), but you should stick to one or the other. I prefer posted date.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="vi-tallying-up-assets-and-liabilities-in-the-balance-sheet">VI. Tallying Up Assets and Liabilities in the Balance Sheet</h3>

<p>Now onto the <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> tab of the budget template. This is where you will add up all the money you have and owe in your accounts. This will ultimately tell you if your wealth/net worth is increasing or decreasing. Make sure you’ve filled out the preliminary <strong>Dashboard</strong> steps first (see points 1-4 above).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Because this is counting the actual numbers in your account, you don’t necessarily have to record every expense. Sometimes there are expenses that don’t quite make sense to include that could throw off measuring your spending. But don’t worry, as long as the <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> is accurate, measuring your cash balance and net worth over time will still be accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To start, name the accounts in <strong>Column A</strong> (mostly the savings accounts and assets). Examples of savings accounts can include primary, emergency fund, and vacation fund. Assets can be your car, credit card miles, 401k, IRA, stocks, etc.</p>

<figure class="figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1">
    <div><img class="image" src="/assets/images/budget10.png" alt="Choose the accounts you want to include as assets on the Balance Sheet tab and give them a nickname" /></div><figcaption class="caption">Choose the accounts you want to include as assets on the Balance Sheet tab and give them a nickname</figcaption></figure>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Unless your comfortable with Google Sheets formulas, this spreadsheet doesn’t support changing the purpose of the accounts that are listed there. It’s okay to not use any of them, but not okay to add or change the purpose of an account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you’ve named your accounts, follow the below steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter your starting date in cell <strong>B1</strong>. Dates are entered in the format of <strong>1/1/2018</strong> (the formatting will display the month’s name and year). In cell <strong>B1</strong>, enter the date of the oldest month you want to start your budget. In most cases, you’ll enter the 1st of the current month or the 1st of last month. You can start further back if you wish, but it will take extra work to calculate historical balances of your accounts. Then in cell <strong>C1</strong>, enter the 1st of the following month. Then continue adding the 1st of every subsequent month until you reach the end of <strong>row 1</strong>. Once completed, the orange instructions in cell <strong>A1</strong> should disappear.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="figure no-dark-filter figure--full gtc-1">
    <div><img class="image" src="/assets/images/budget11.gif" alt="Enter your starting date on the Balance Sheet tab" /></div><figcaption class="caption">Enter your starting date on the Balance Sheet tab</figcaption></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Now you’ll have a header row in <strong>row 1</strong> with the month and year. The numbers you will fill out in the column beneath a month must be the balances at the end of that month. So forget that you used the first of the month in the heading - the reason for that was just to get the month and year to display and to make some formulas work. Just remember, the numbers under a month’s column in the <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> represent where those accounts stand at the end of that month.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: If you’re starting your budget this month, you don’t need to fill out the numbers in the <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> yet. It’s easiest to do this soon after the month ends, either one the 1st of the following month or at least within a few days of it ending. Then all you need to do is pull up your online banking and fill out the balances for all your accounts, credit cards, loans, retirement accounts, etc. <strong>Remember, the numbers in these columns represent how you stand at the end of the month</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Any row that has a <strong>-</strong> in the cell means these numbers are auto calculated with Google Sheets formulas. Grey shaded cells are intentionally left blank due to the nature of what it’s calculating (for example you need 3 months of data before it can calculate a 3 month rolling average). Here’s what the <strong>Assets &amp; Income</strong> section will look like once you have some data in there:</li>
</ul>

<figure class="figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1">
    <div><img class="image" src="/assets/images/budget12.png" alt="Example of the Assets &amp; Income section with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab" /></div><figcaption class="caption">Example of the Assets &amp; Income section with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab</figcaption></figure>

<ul>
  <li>For <strong>Rent Due</strong> in <strong>row 30</strong>, I always set to $0. Rent should be paid on the 1st and I don’t like to include it as money owed. If I’m filling out the <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> for a month where rent hasn’t yet been deducted from my checking account, I’ll subtract it from my current checking balance for a more accurate representation of my month’s finances. I do the same thing for credit card payments when it applies - pay my credit card and if it hasn’t been reflected in my credit card or checking balance, I manually subtract the amount from my credit card balance and the amount I paid from my checking account. Here’s what the <strong>Liabilities</strong> section looks like with sample date.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1">
    <div><img class="image" src="/assets/images/budget13.png" alt="Example of the Liabilities secion with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab" /></div><figcaption class="caption">Example of the Liabilities secion with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab</figcaption></figure>

<ul>
  <li>The categories under <strong>Monthly Expenses</strong> starting in <strong>row 36</strong> are auto populated from the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab. The sums of each category are then auto calculated from the <strong>Expenses</strong> tab so you don’t need to do anything here. The same is true for <strong>Annual Expenses</strong> starting at <strong>row 50</strong>. If you spend in an annual expense category, it won’t count towards your monthly budget and instead will pull from the future “pool” of money set aside for annual expenses you decllare in the <strong>Annual Reccuring</strong> box on the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1">
    <div><img class="image" src="/assets/images/budget14.png" alt="Example of the Monthly and Annual Expenses secions with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab" /></div><figcaption class="caption">Example of the Monthly and Annual Expenses secions with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab</figcaption></figure>

<ul>
  <li>The last section is the <strong>Totals</strong> section that brings everything together to calculate your net checking balance (money in checking minus current credit card balances) and your net worth. In <strong>row 72</strong> you can leave notes for yourself if something unusual occurred in a given month. The word “Notes” will auto populate in each month, but to leave a note, right-click the cell and select “Insert note.”</li>
</ul>

<figure class="figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1">

<p>And that’s all you do the <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> at the end of each month. As you use this Google Sheets budget template each month, more data on the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab will start to populate and be useful.</p>

<h3 id="vii-net-worth-summary">VII. Net Worth Summary</h3>

<p>Back on the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab, the <strong>Summary</strong> box will show an overview of the most recent balances you entered on the <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> tab compared to the previous completed month. Then it also compares your <strong>Latest</strong> with the previous <strong>3 Month Average</strong>, which makes it easy to see if your money is increasing or decreasing. You’ll need at least 4 months of completed data for the <strong>Summary</strong> box to completely work. Don’t worry or change any of the formulas here if it throws an error.</p>

<figure class="figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1">
    <div><img class="image" src="/assets/images/budget7.png" alt="The Summary box on the Dashbord tab shows whether your net worth is growing or shrinking" /></div><figcaption class="caption">The Summary box on the Dashbord tab shows whether your net worth is growing or shrinking</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="viii-spent-vs-budget">VIII. Spent vs Budget</h3>

<p>Further down the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab, you’ll see the <strong>Spent vs Budget</strong> box. This is a graph that compares your spending in each category to the budget you set for that category in the <strong>Monthly Budget</strong> box. Use the dropdown selector in cell <strong>P30</strong> to change the category or choose ‘Total.’</p>

<figure class="figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1">

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: This graph shows the previous seven months of data so it won’t be fully complete until you have at least seven months of complete data. And it won’t show any data at all until you have data from at least one previous month in your <strong>Expenses</strong> and <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> tabs (It doesn’t show current month). Again, don’t change any formulas or the chart as it will still work fine if you don’t have all seven months yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ix-expenses-last-seven-months">IX. Expenses Last Seven Months</h3>

<p>Below the <strong>Spent vs Budget</strong> box is the same data but in a table format in the <strong>Expenses Last 7 Months</strong> box. This is another way to compare your spending vs budget by category. Amounts will be red where you overspent.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-budgeting-tips">Bonus Budgeting Tips</h2>

<p>A budget is only good if you update it consistently, keep it accurate, and spend time analyzing your spending. That’s why I made it a point to make this budget template in Google Sheets look nice, be easy to use, and be rewarding to use.</p>

<p>But sometimes that’s still not enough. <strong>There’s definitely been times where I don’t do it for a few weeks at a time and the more you wait, the more work you’ll have to do, and the more you won’t look forward to doing it</strong>. I‘ve made it a habit to log my expenses every Sunday vs once every month.</p>

<p>Another tip is to use a credit card for all transactions when possible. Using a credit card makes it much easier to keep track of your spending and at the same time protects your bank account from fraud, builds your credit, and you can earn points and rewards.</p>
