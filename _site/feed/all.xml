&lt;p&gt;These problems and solutions were published in his book &lt;em&gt;The War on Normal People&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book had a big impact on me. I have a better understanding of the kind of life the average American has and it increased the empathy I have for those in our country who are less fortunate than me. Yang brings up a variety of problems Americans face (and solutions), which I haven’t heard from politicians before. This had me questioning “what are the success metrics for a country?” And not least of all, it convinced me universal basic income should be seriously considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into three parts: jobs, people, and solutions. The thesis of each are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jobs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millions of jobs have and will continue to be lost to automation and artificial intelligence. New jobs created from emerging technology won’t cover the amount of jobs lost, new jobs will be consolidated in cities abundant with tech and highly educated talent, and the people who do lose their jobs can’t be trained to fill the new jobs. This will cause a “great displacement” of tens of millions of workers across the country, affecting rural and small cities the hardest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second part, Yang reveals more of his personal philosophy as he shows how the quality of American life is deteriorating. This quote sets the stage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…many of us came up through the meritocracy and we’ve internalized its lessons. The underlying logic of the meritocratic system is this: if you’re successful, it’s because you’re smart and hardworking, and thus virtuous. If you’re poor or unsuccessful, it’s because you’re lazy and/or stupid and of subpar character. The people at the top belong there and the people at the bottom only have themselves to blame.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High rates of unemployment and under employment are linked to an array of social problems, including substance abuse, domestic violence, child abuse, drug abuse, depression, lower marriage rates, and the fragmentation of the family structure with rising rates of single mothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part three, Yang lays out his case for a new way forward, beginning with changing the utility of free market capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We must make the market serve humanity rather than have humanity continue to serve the market. We must simultaneously become more dynamic and more empathetic as a society.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rise of automation and artificial intelligence (AI), capital will continue to consolidate and leave people behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In the United States, we want to believe that the market will resolve most situations. In this case, the market will not solve the problem - quite the opposite. The market is driven to reduce costs. It will look to find the the cheapest way to perform tasks… The market will continue to throw millions of people out of the labor force as automation and technology improve. In order for society to continue to function and thrive when tens of millions of Americans don’t have jobs, we will need to rethink the relationship between work and being able to pay for basic needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His solution is a form of universal basic income (UBI) of $1,000/mo for every American citizen from the age of 18 to death. One thousand dollars is somewhat of a magic number. It’s not enough to live off and serve as a job replacement, but it’s enough to serve as an income supplement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary-of-the-war-on-normal-people&quot;&gt;Summary of The War on Normal People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yang’s thesis on the economy and the future is this: automation and AI is putting us through the “fourth industrial revolution.” This will cause millions of workers to be displaced, especially hitting rural communities the hardest. The solution is a universal basic income to help people through the transition, provide an influx of money into every community in the country, and give people a bigger safety net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His universal basic income proposal would cost ~$3 trillion per year, while the existing federal budget is ~$4 trillion. Before looking more into his proposals to fund it, here is his reasoning for why it’s needed in the first place. Note that there are far more data points in the book than presented here. I simply chose what I think to be most interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-one-whats-happening-to-jobs&quot;&gt;Part one: What’s happening to jobs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, there are several chapters full of statistics to show how the current economy is not benefiting “normal people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;job-growth-has-been-on-the-decline&quot;&gt;Job growth has been on the decline&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we can see historical data for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS#0&quot;&gt;total number of employed people over the past several decades&lt;/a&gt;. Although the number of employed people is clearly not decreasing, the &lt;em&gt;rate at which it’s growing&lt;/em&gt; is on the decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book, Yang shows job growth is on the decline, but he presents it grouped by ten-year-long increments. When I downloaded this data and looked into it further, I found this narrative of declining job growth to change based on where you start the groupings. With Yang’s choice, job growth appears to be on a sharp decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--full gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/andrew-yang-war-on-normal-people-jobs-added-to-economy.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/andrew-yang-war-on-normal-people-jobs-added-to-economy.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/andrew-yang-war-on-normal-people-jobs-added-to-economy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Job growth decline as portrayed in 'The War on Normal People'&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Job growth decline as portrayed in 'The War on Normal People'&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why not just present the annual growth rate in a line graph?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/andrew-yang-war-on-normal-people-job-growth-rate-chart.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/andrew-yang-war-on-normal-people-job-growth-rate-chart.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/andrew-yang-war-on-normal-people-job-growth-rate-chart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Annual U.S. job growth rate, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Annual U.S. job growth rate, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The periods of declining job growth align with economic recessions and, as Yang points out, each of these recessions have &lt;em&gt;“stripped out more jobs and taken longer to recover from than the last,”&lt;/em&gt;. This does appear to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yang warns there aren’t as many new jobs being created as there used to and eventually we’ll have a negative job growth rate. But the amount of new jobs being created is irrelevant without taking into consideration population. That’s why the unemployment rate exists, but &lt;strong&gt;the problem with the unemployment rate is it doesn’t take into account &lt;em&gt;“people who drop out of the workforce for any reason, including disability or simply giving up trying to find a job… It also doesn’t take into account people who are underemployed - that is, if a college graduate takes a job as a barista or other role that doesn’t require a degree.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is such a thing to help account for this called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE&quot;&gt;“U-6” Unemployment rate&lt;/a&gt;, which does looks healthy and is currently at its lowest rate since we began tracking this metric (1994). However, we can also look at the arguably better &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CIVPART&quot;&gt;civilian labor force participation rate&lt;/a&gt;, which is a percentage of the number of people in the labor force (people employed/looking for employment) compared to the total civilian population (over 16, non-military, not confined to an institution). Most notably, this includes people who have given up looking for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/andrew-yang-war-on-normal-people-labor-participation-rate.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/andrew-yang-war-on-normal-people-labor-participation-rate.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/andrew-yang-war-on-normal-people-labor-participation-rate.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;U.S. labor force participation rate, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CIVPART&quot;&gt;U.S. labor force participation rate, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current labor force participation rate is 62.6%, a rate which we haven’t seen since 2015, and since then the late 1970s. It’s down 7% since its all time high of around 67.3% in 2000. To put this into perspective, a 100 basis point decrease in the rate represents around 2.5M people leaving the labor force. So a 7% decrease represents 17.5M people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m not sure what a healthy labor force participation rate is, I assume more people working who are of working age is better for the economy, but 63% is in line with other comparable countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.ZS&quot;&gt;according to The World Bank&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;India&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;49%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Japan&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;62%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Netherlands&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;66%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;South Korea&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;64%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;UK&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;62%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yang’s point is &lt;em&gt;“the numbers clearly show an economy that is having a harder time creating new jobs at previous levels.”&lt;/em&gt; While jobs are still growing, job &lt;em&gt;growth rate&lt;/em&gt; is on the decline and at a slower rate than the growth of the working age population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is this happening? Yang’s big hypothesis is that automation and AI are taking jobs from people and will continue to take them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Companies can now prosper, grow, and mint record profits without hiring many people or increasing wages. Both job creation and wage growth have been weaker than the top-line economic growth would suggest since the 1970s.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest tech companies of today compared to the largest companies of the “last generation” have far less employees, but with a higher market cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Yang compared Apple to IBM as an example of this, I think a more revealing example of the direct effect technology has on jobs and company value is Blockbuster compared to Netflix. Blockbuster at its peak in 2004 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_LLC&quot;&gt;employed 84,300 people&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibtimes.com/sad-end-blockbuster-video-onetime-5-billion-company-being-liquidated-competition-1496962&quot;&gt;market cap of $8.1B&lt;/a&gt; after adjusting for inflation. Netflix, who killed Blockbuster through technological innovation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/587671/netflix-employees/&quot;&gt;employs just 12,800 people&lt;/a&gt; with a market cap of $186.9B - 85% less employees and a 2,207% higher market cap. &lt;strong&gt;Companies of today, with the advancements in technology, can create much more valuable companies with much fewer employees.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;who-is-normal-in-america&quot;&gt;Who is normal in America&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tend to derive our sense of the country by what we see around us, but the following statistics probably show an America very different from what you’re familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is normal according to the U.S. Census Bureau:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2021/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html&quot;&gt;only 38% of Americans 25 years and older have a bachelor’s degree or more; 61% if Asian, 42% if white, 28% if black, and only 21% if Hispanic (2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-pinc/pinc-01.2021.html#list-tab-2012835591&quot;&gt;median personal income of Americans 25 years and older is $41.6k with nearly 70% making $65k or less (2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/histtabs.html&quot;&gt;66% of Americans own their own home as of 2023, down from the high of 69% in 2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the median income &lt;em&gt;growth&lt;/em&gt; for people 25 years or older over the last 24 years (1997 to 2021) was only 14.9% after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/&quot;&gt;adjusting for inflation&lt;/a&gt;. The S&amp;amp;P 500, on the other hand, rose 190.9% over the same time period. This comparison isn’t made directly in &lt;em&gt;The War on Normal People,&lt;/em&gt; but mediocre job and wage growth over the past 20 years shows that a rising stock market doesn’t drive or align with wage growth. It is likely more correlated with unemployment rates, but is it also correlated with wealth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We tend to use the stock market’s performance as a shorthand indicator of national well-being. However, the &lt;strong&gt;median level of stock market investment is close to zero&lt;/strong&gt;. Only 52% of Americans own any stock through a stock mutual fund or a self-directed 401(k) or IRA, and the bottom 80% of Americans own only 8% of all stocks. […] This means that the average American benefits minimally from a rising stock market beyond the wealth effect, which is that the rich people around them spend more money and the economy is more buoyant.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx&quot;&gt;American stock ownership was at 52% in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, it is now at 61%, which has been about the average level. But according to the Federal Reserve, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/research/how-many-americans-own-stock/&quot;&gt;bottom 90% of Americans by net worth do only own 11.1% of all stocks&lt;/a&gt;, which is a 37.9% decline since 1989. So an increasing stock market also adds only a little benefit to the wealth of most Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-we-do-for-a-living&quot;&gt;What we do for a living&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/emp-by-major-occupational-group.htm&quot;&gt;five largest occupational groups in the US&lt;/a&gt; (in 2016) are office and administrative support, sales and retail, food preparation and serving, transportation and material moving, and production. In total, 69 million Americans work in these groups, which is 47% of the total American workforce. Yang claims each of these groups is at risk of being severely affected by automation and AI. As of 2021, production is no longer a top five occupation, and it has been replaced with management occupations. For the sake of covering the book, I’m going to ignore this change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”Although the seriousness of [automation] has not reached the mainstream yet, […] many Americans are in danger of losing their job right now due to automation. Not in 10 or 15 years. Right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a table of the number of employees in these occupational groups from 2016 and 2021 compared to the total workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;9.1M&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;8.8M&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;-3%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, only one group did not decline in job count since 2016: transportation increased 37%. It’s difficult to say the decline in office and admin jobs was due mainly to automation without significant research. Transportation jobs jumped, but the decline of jobs in transportation is not expected until full autonomous trucks are ready for the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes it is interesting that four out of the top five occupations are declining, however total jobs are increasing and the occupations that are growing appear at first glance to have a higher median wage. Although this is good overall, this could be bad for the folks who are losing these jobs and don’t have the qualifications to enter the growing, and higher paying occupations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Transportation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all these occupational groups, Yang’s largest concern are truck drivers. At least in 2014, driving trucks is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state&quot;&gt;most common job in 29 states&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trucking.org/economics-and-industry-data&quot;&gt;3.54 million truck drivers nationwide (2022)&lt;/a&gt;. They are mostly high school graduate men with an average age of 49.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are huge financial incentives for transportation companies to adopt autonomous transportation vehicles. Not only are the 3.5 million truck drivers at risk of losing their jobs, but also the businesses along these routes to serve the drivers when they need to eat, drink, rest, sleep etc. Yang claims there are “as many as 7.2 million workers [who] serve the needs of divers at truck stops, diners, motels and other businesses,” but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.route-fifty.com/infrastructure/2015/05/driverless-trucks-small-town-economic-impact/113101/&quot;&gt;his source for this figure&lt;/a&gt; didn’t specify this number and the American Trucking Associations put the figure at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trucking.org/economics-and-industry-data&quot;&gt;4.35 million&lt;/a&gt;, however it’s not clear if this figure also represents workers outside of the trucking industry who serve truckers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, as of 2021 and compared to 2016 and back to 2000, jobs in the transportation sector have greatly increased. However, autonomous trucks have yet to really hit the market so the impact of automation on this and related industries are yet to be seen and Yang can’t say &lt;em&gt;“I told you so”&lt;/em&gt; just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP&quot;&gt;More than 5 million manufacturing workers lost their jobs after the year 2000&lt;/a&gt;, due to a combination of trade (outsourcing) and automation. Although there is debate as to which is the major cause, Yang cites a Ball State University study that attributes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/dec677c0-b7e6-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62&quot;&gt;85% of these job losses to technological change and automation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2013 survey of these displaced manufacturing workers found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geartechnology.com/issues/0813x/displaced_manufacturing_workers.pdf&quot;&gt;41% were still unemployed by January 2012&lt;/a&gt; or dropped out of the labor market within three years of losing their job. Of the 59% who found re-employment, 69% found employment in different fields. The manufacturing jobs that still exist are requiring more technical expertise and advanced education. Since 2000, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/01/america-is-still-making-things/512282/#:~:text=Manufacturing%2C%20like%20most%20other%20industries,as%20it%20did%20in%201960.&quot;&gt;manufacturing jobs for people with less than a high-school education fell 44% and jobs requiring a graduate degree grew by 32%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the 41% of displaced manufacturing workers become destitute and apply for disability to survive. From 2000 to 2011, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/di_asr/2019/sect01a.pdf&quot;&gt;the number of workers on disability rose by 3.5 million&lt;/a&gt;. Yang states this was mostly in manufacturing-heavy states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, but he didn’t provide a specific source other than Michigan. About &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20150726/NEWS/307269975/disability-rolls-surge-in-state&quot;&gt;half of the 310,000 residents who left the workforce in Michigan between 2003 and 2013 went on disability&lt;/a&gt;. One in 12 adults aged 18-64 in Michigan receive disability and it’s the state with the 7th largest population receiving disability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2023, manufacturing jobs have not recovered to the levels seen in 2,000. The above data shows that it’s difficult for these people to find new work; however, and it bears repeating, the total number of employed people is still growing. The situation these folks find themselves is unfortunate, but whether this is a piece of a bigger crisis to come is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About White Collar Jobs and AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automation is not limited to replacing just blue-collar jobs with routine functions, but also white collar jobs including doctors, lawyers, accountants, wealth advisors, traders, psychologists, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super-intelligent computers (and AI), are entering the market, which can synthesize complex data sets, perform tasks, and make decisions as good as or better than humans, leading to a dramatic change in the way companies operate and employ people. As time goes on, “employing lots of people will mean that you’re behind the times.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve categorizes 44% of total jobs as routine, which are in danger of automation and AI to replace workers. As this occurs, workers will only be left with either low-end service jobs or high-end cognitive jobs with middle-skill jobs disappearing. The Fed is calling this “job polarization” and will lead to increasing income inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Humanity and Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s worth considering whether humans are not actually best suited for many forms of work. Consider also the reverse: Are most forms of work ideal for humans? That is, if we’re not good for work, is work good for us?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between humanity and work reveals a negative correlation between the most human roles and their monetary compensation. While roles such as parent, artist, or teacher often have high social impact, they typically receive low or no pay. Conversely, lucrative jobs like corporate lawyers or financiers require a higher degree of efficiency and detachment from human qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-two-whats-happening-to-us&quot;&gt;Part two: What’s happening to us&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part two, Yang makes several points about how the quality of life for normal Americans is breaking down in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;life-in-the-bubble&quot;&gt;Life in the bubble&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our smartest college graduates are being absorbed by the financial services and technology industries out of Manhattan and Silicon Valley. Why? They want to succeed and success is heavily defined by market success. And failure to succeed brings catastrophic economic and social consequences. So college isn’t a time for intellectual exploration, it’s a mass sift that determines one’s future prospects and lot in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In the bubble, many of us came up through the meritocracy and we’ve internalized its lessons. The underlying logic of the meritocratic system is this: if you’re successful, it’s because you’re smart and hardworking, and thus virtuous. If you’re poor or unsuccessful, it’s because you’re lazy and/or stupid and of subpar character. The people at the top belong there and the people at the bottom only have themselves to blame.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But success in entering these industries isn’t actually as meritocratic as the ones in the bubble like to admit. It’s more so based on one’s family background, the community in which one lives, and one’s ability to score high on tests. Therefore if success and a life worth living is defined by market success, then human worth is defined by test scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The logic of the marketplace is seductive to all of us. It gives everything a tinge of justice. It makes the suffering of the marginalized more palatable, in that there’s a sense that they deserve it. Perhaps the most remarkable thing is that they often agree - they think they deserve it, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mindsets-of-scarcity-and-abundance&quot;&gt;Mindsets of Scarcity and Abundance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a mindset of scarcity. The average American lives paycheck to paycheck with a variable work schedule. This means they spend a lot of bandwidth stressing about uncertainties - enough hours to work, enough money to pay bills, what days they have off to set appointments, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A culture of scarcity is a culture of negativity. People think about what can go wrong. They attacked each other. Tribalism and divisiveness go way up. Reason starts to lose ground. Decision-making gets systematically worse. Acts of sustained optimism - getting married, starting a business, moving for a new job - all go down. If this seems familiar, this is exactly what we’re seeing by the numbers here in America. We are quickly transforming from the land of plenty to the land of “you get yours, I’ll get mine.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;geography-is-destiny&quot;&gt;Geography is Destiny&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the available good jobs and opportunity start decreasing in a city or town, the first people to leave are the most educated who have the best opportunities elsewhere. So they move out, and the average education level of that city starts to decrease as well. This is why America’s most educated people congregate in CA (Silicon Valley) and NY (Manhattan) and smaller cities tend not to prosper at the same rate. Although remote work is starting to change this, it is yet to be determined if this is a long term trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last 15 years, the majority of cities in America have seen more business close than open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A series of studies by the economists Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren showed how important where you grow up is to your future prospects… If a child from a low-mobility area moved to a better-performing area, each year produced positive effects on his or her future earnings. They were also more likely to attend college, less likely to become single parents, and more likely to earn more with each year spent in the better environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;men-women-and-children&quot;&gt;Men, Women, and Children&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A Pew research study showed that many men are foregoing or delaying marriage because they do not feel financially secure. The same study said that, for women, having a steady job was the single biggest factor they were looking for in a spouse. Getting married is an act of optimism, stability, and prosperity. It can also be expensive. If you don’t have a stable job all of the above becomes more difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all education attainment levels, marriage rates are declining, but are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2017/09/14/as-u-s-marriage-rate-hovers-at-50-education-gap-in-marital-status-widens/&quot;&gt;declining much more sharply in the lowest levels of education attinment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of babies born to unmarried women is 40%, up from 30% in the early 1990’s, and up from 15% in the late 1970’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“At a time when raising and educating children and forming our human capital is of the utmost importance, we’re heading in the other direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-permanent-shadow-class-what-displacement-looks-like&quot;&gt;The Permanent Shadow Class: What Displacement Looks Like&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an absurd amount of Americans on and applying for disability benefits every year. In 2014, nearly 2.5m Americans applied for disability and 9m working-age Americans are currently receiving disability benefits. It has become not only a bloated bureaucratic government program, but also a big private industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After someone receives disability benefits, only 1% ever return to the workforce despite the average monthly benefit amount being only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ssa.gov/disabilityfacts/facts.html&quot;&gt;$1,234/mo as of 2019&lt;/a&gt;. This is barely enough to keep someone above the poverty line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The fact that a program designed for a relatively small number of Americans has now become such a major lifeline for people and communities is part of the Great Displacement. […] After one gets on disability, one enters a permanent shadow class of beneficiaries. Even if you start feeling better, you’re not going to risk a lifetime of benefits for a tenuous job that could disappear at any moment. And it’s likely easier to think of yourself as genuinely disabled than as someone cheating society for a monthly draw.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Disability illustrates the challenges of mandating the government to administer such a large-scale program. It’s essentially the worst of all worlds, as the truly disabled and needy may find themselves shut out by red tape, while the process rewards those who lawyer up and the lawyers themselves. It sends a pervasive message of “game the system and get money” and “think of yourself as incompetent and incapable of work.” It’s subject to fraud. And once you’re on, you never leave.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-shape-were-in--disintegration&quot;&gt;The Shape We’re In / Disintegration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These worrying trends show Americans are not in great shape right now and will make transitioning to a new economy much more difficult:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we are getting older&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we don’t have adequate savings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we are financially insecure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we use a lot of drugs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we are not starting new businesses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we’re depressed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we owe a lot of money, public and private&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;our education system underperforms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;our economy is consolidating around a few mega-powerful firms in our most important industries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;our media is fragmented&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;our social capital is lower&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we don’t trust institutions anymore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Among the things being questioned is our capitalist system. Among young people, polls show a very high degree of sympathy for other types of economies, in part because they’ve witnessed capitalism’s failures and excesses these past years.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…capitalism, with the assistance of technology, is about to turn on normal people. Capital and efficiency will prefer robots, software, AI, and machines to people more and more. [Capitalism and technology] started saying things like, “Ah, let’s automate everything” and “if the market doesn’t like it, get rid of it,” which made reasonable people increasingly nervous.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If capitalism in America continues as it is with the rise of AI and automation, there will be an even more staggering increase in income inequality. Society will be dramatically bifurcated between the rich (educated) and poor (uneducated), desperation and destabilization will rise, and could spur a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If there is a revolution, it is likely to be born of race and identity with automation-driven economics as the underlying force. A highly disproportionate number of people at the top will be educated whites, Jews, and Asians… African Americans and Latinos will almost certainly make up a disproportionate number of the less privileged in the wake of automation, as they currently enjoy lower levels of wealth and education. Racial inequality will become all the more jarring as the new majority remains on the outside. […] Less privileged whites may be more likely to blame people of color, immigrants, or shifting cultural norms for their diminishing stature and shattered communities than they will automation and the capitalist system. Culture wars will be the proxy wars for the economic backdrop.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-three-solutions-and-human-capitalism&quot;&gt;Part Three: Solutions and Human Capitalism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-freedom-dividend&quot;&gt;The Freedom Dividend&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core solution Yang advocates for is a universal basic income - a monthly check of $1,000 to each U.S. citizen above the age of 18 regardless of the city they live in, the number of dependents they have, work status, or the amount of income they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The first major change would be to implement a universal basic income (UBI), which I would call the ‘Freedom Dividend.’ The United States should provide an annual income of $12,000 for each American aged 18 [and above], with the amount indexed to increase with inflation. It would require a constitutional super majority to modify or amend. The Freedom Dividend would replace the vast majority of existing welfare programs. This plan was proposed by Andy Stern, the former head of the largest labor union in the country, in his book &lt;em&gt;Raising the Floor&lt;/em&gt;. The poverty line is currently $11,770. We would essentially be bringing all Americans to the poverty line and alleviate gross poverty.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main critiques of UBI that make people quickly dismiss even considering it. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$1,000/mo is only enough money to scrape by&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it will cost too much to implement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it will cause runaway inflation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first let’s talk about why UBI is worth considering before addressing these critiques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;benefits-of-ubi&quot;&gt;Benefits of UBI&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to traditional welfare programs, a UBI with no strings attached removes the disincentive for people to work as wages earned from working will stack on top of UBI. And in contrast to increasing minimum wages, it will give people more flexibility with the work they choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would be a massive stimulus to lower-cost areas of living as the spending power of residents dramatically increases.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would make losing a job less stressful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would empower workers with the ability to leave exploitative employers and find better work environments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would allow people to work jobs they enjoy even if the pay is less than they could earn in a job they dislike.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would help people avoid making terrible decisions based on financial scarcity and month-to-month needs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would increase rates of entrepreneurship by reducing the risk of starting a business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would enable people to more effectively transition from shrinking industries and environments to new ones.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would reduce stress, improve health, decrease crime, and strengthen relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would support parents and caretakers for the work that they do, particularly mothers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would give all citizens an honest stake in society and a sense of the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would stimulate and maintain the consumer economy through the automation wave.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would maintain order and preserve our way of life through the greatest economic and social transition in history.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would make our society more equitable, fair, and just.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;cost&quot;&gt;Cost&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give $1,000/mo to all citizens above the age of 18 would cost somewhere around $1.3 trillion per year. So how could the US government pay for it? The two biggest sources of potential are folding existing welfare programs and implementing a new value added tax (VAT). A VAT is a tax on consumption, levied on non-essential goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All developed countries have a VAT except for the US. And in Europe, the average VAT is 20%. A VAT’s efficacy has been solidly established. Obviously, implementing a VAT on non-essential goods would increase the cost of those goods; however, essential goods for people’s basic needs shouldn’t be affected. This means people with a low income who spend the majority of their income on essential goods will be affected the least from a VAT and will benefit the most from UBI. At a 20% VAT, one spending less than $60,000 per year on non-essential goods will come out on top with a UBI + VAT policy (20% of $60k = $12k). Therefore, only high income earners (and spenders) will pay more in tax after their UBI is accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, not every category of good would have a 20% VAT. Depending on the type of good, a different percentage of a VAT could be applied. For example, clothing could have a 10% VAT while new cars could have a 25% VAT and et cetera. These percentages could be tweaked to again affect low income earners and spenders less so than high income earners and spenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“UBI… is not shaming - everyone participates. It does not try to control the economy from the top - people can spend their money on what they want and therefore steer the economy as it has always been best steered, by the consumer. It could free up the job market in ways that are hard to appreciate… I am entranced by UBI, not just as a needed fix but as an institute that unleashes people’s potential… I find myself convinced that UBI is natural, and would lead to a more productive and happier world - and it would allow us to fully harness people’s creativity and the technology they create.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Richard Garfield, creator of Magic: The Gathering&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike America’s current welfare program, a UBI shouldn’t increase the size of the government or create a new bureaucracy. There would be no qualifying criteria or capacity limits and therefore no need for the thousands of government employees that are needed to administer today’s welfare benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[UBI is] less an expenditure and more a transfer to citizens so they can use it to improve their lives, pay each other, patron the local businesses, and support the consumer economy. Instead of hiring a new army of government employees, every dollar will be put into the hands of an American citizen and then largely spent within the American economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some critics of UBI might say that if we give people cash instead of vouchers (like food stamps), people will just spend it on drugs, alcohol, or gamble it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The idea that poor people will be irresponsible with their money and squander it seems to be a product of deep-seated biases rather than emblematic of the truth. There’s a tendency for rich people to dismiss poor people as weak-willed children with no cost discipline. The evidence runs in the other direction. As the Dutch philosopher Rutger Bregman and others put it, “Poverty is not a lack of character. It’s a lack of cash.”
“Scarcity research indicates that the best way to improve decision making is to free up people’s bandwidth. People won’t ever make perfect choices. But knowing that their basic needs are accounted for will lead to better choices for millions of people each day.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to a job guarantee policy, which would be very difficult to organize and create a huge bureaucracy, a UBI would more naturally create jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Many people have some artistic passion that they would pursue if they didn’t need to worry about feeding themselves next month. A UBI would be perhaps the greatest catalyst to human creativity we have ever seen. Perhaps most crucially, endless new businesses would form. This would play out over and over again throughout the economy, resulting in millions of new jobs - 4.7 million according to the Roosevelt Institute’s analysis. A UBI would address a significant proportion of the lack of work through increased humanity, caring, creativity, and enterprise.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;human-capitalism&quot;&gt;Human Capitalism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the goal of our country? Of our government? Well, outside of wartime, the answer seems absent other than increasing GDP every year and keeping inflation and unemployment in control - all economy focused. But should it not be to ever improve the lives of all its citizens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part one of the book, it’s clear improving the well-being of citizens is not the goal. If it is, then we’re doing the exact opposite. Instead of improving the economy above all else, Yang proposes what he calls “Human Capitalism,” which is geared toward maximizing human well-being and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Human Capitalism would have a few core tenets: (1.) Humanity is more important than money. (2.) The unit of an economy is each person, each dollar. (3.) Markets exist to serve our common goals and values.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Our economic system must shift to focus on bettering the lot of the average person. Capitalism has to be made to serve human ends and goals, rather than have our humanity subverted to serve the marketplace. We shape the system. We own it, not the other way around.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do we measure a country’s current state and progress of improving the well-being and fulfillment of its citizens? Here are some ideas Yang proposes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;median income and standard of living&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;levels of engagement with work and labor participation rate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;health-adjusted life expectancy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;childhood success rates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;infant mortality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;surveys of national well-being&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;average physical fitness and mental health&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;quality of infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;proportion of elderly in quality care&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;human capital development and access to education&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;marriage rates and success&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deaths of despair/despair index/substance abuse&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;national optimism/mindset of abundance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;community integrity and social capital&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;environmental quality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reacclimation of incarcerated individuals and rates of criminality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Human Capitalism will reshape the way we measure value and progress, and help us redefine why we do what we do.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yang continues this section of the book on requirements for human capitalism to take effect in our government with ideas and suggestions for new policies to help the US get closer. Ideas range from congressional salary changes, work restrictions after terms are over, anti-corruption/anti-lobbying, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Yang has various ideas to improve the health care system because how it’s setup currently doesn’t provide the best incentives for either businesses, care providers, or the people receiving care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to improving the lives of people at the individual level, Yang focuses heavily on education, suggesting improvements in both quality and access. As shown in part one, a person’s education level is one of the biggest leading indicators of one’s earning potential and quality of life. Yang dissects many of the issues with the current education system in the US and provides ideas and suggestions on how to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve reduced a great length of the end of the book into the previous three paragraphs. While each chapter I’ve found very interesting, I think the core ideas of UBI and human-centered capitalism to be the most important in his book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I love most about Yang’s “The War on Normal People” is its theory on how a country ought to be, what it should strive for, and how its progress toward that goal ought to be measured. I recommend this book for people interested in data-driven political theory and political ideas outside contemporary thought.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Reggie Paquette</name></author><category term="[&quot;all&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Andrew Yang was a U.S. presidential candidate in the 2020 election who caught the attention of myself and millions of others through his unique approach to identifying and solving many of America’s problems.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/andrew-yang-war-on-normal-people.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/andrew-yang-war-on-normal-people.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Why I Became Vegan</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/vegan" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why I Became Vegan" /><published>2023-01-14T16:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-01-14T16:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/vegan</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/vegan">&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost three years since I stopped eating or buying anything made from animals because I became convinced it’s unethical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t a conclusion I reached on a whim. It took many years for my mind to change. Most people think being vegan is a diet, but I learned veganism is really a philosophy. This is my first time writing about it, so for now I only want to cover the definition of veganism and why I find its core argument so convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-veganism&quot;&gt;What is veganism?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s true that someone who doesn’t eat or drink anything made wholly or partly from animals is vegan, it doesn’t capture the complete picture of veganism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a definition for veganism I’ve slightly modified from The Vegan Society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to avoid the exploitation and use of animals-as far as is possible and practicable-for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; purpose, including food, clothing, furniture, entertainment, makeup, personal products, and any other items that use materials or ingredients derived from animals.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophical part of veganism is really about ethics. Like humans, non-human animals are conscious and sentient beings. They have individual personalities, desires, experience pleasures, and feel pain. &lt;strong&gt;Despite being a different species from humans, their preferences for seeking pleasures and avoiding pain should be respected and protected.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veganism is about taking the most basic and fundamental natural right that we believe all humans have, the right to life, and extending it to animals.&lt;/strong&gt; We shouldn’t treat sentient beings like objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think most people think being vegan is a more ethical choice than not, but also that it’s not &lt;em&gt;unethical&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be vegan. The difference is veganism says &lt;em&gt;it is&lt;/em&gt; unethical to not be vegan. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;core-argument-for-veganism&quot;&gt;Core argument for veganism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animals suffer in the production of animal products, and since we have access to sufficient alternatives that don’t require the use of animals to be made, that means products made from animals are unnecessary and the animal suffering is unnecessary. It is unethical to cause unnecessary suffering, therefore it is unethical to consume, purchase, or create products made from animals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are to believe it’s &lt;em&gt;not unethical&lt;/em&gt; to take and use the bodies of animals for food and other materials, then we must have a truly legitimate &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; for them that is &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; to be satisfied in any other &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the most obvious &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; of animal products would be for food. We need to eat to survive, right? And generally, meat, eggs, milk, etc. contains the important nutrients we need to survive. &lt;strong&gt;However, because it’s &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to get these nutrients from a plant-based diet, then we don’t need animal products to survive. Yes, we need food to survive, but that food doesn’t need to come from animals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it was not possible to eat a plant-based diet and live a healthy life (or in other words that didn’t cause illness or premature death), then eating food made from animals would be necessary, and the suffering animals would go through to produce that food would generally not be unethical to inflict. However, there already has been more than sufficient research done to show that people can not only survive on a plant-based diet, but is often correlated with reduced risk of cancer and longer life spans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But is it &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; to switch to a healthy plant-based diet? Well, I admit it’s not easy and there are some costs.&lt;/strong&gt; You will have to learn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what you need to eat to be healthy on a plant-based diet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how to shop at grocery stores and read ingredients labels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what and how to order at restaurants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;how to deal with social events that revolve around food&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people think it would be too difficult for them to switch to a vegan diet, but after a few months most of these become non issues. The only thing I still find somewhat of a challenge after being vegan for nearly three years is the social aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, none of these obstacles make switching to a vegan diet impractical enough for us to say we have a legitamte need for animal products. The far majority of people living in first world countries have access to modern grocery stores that have everything one would need to eat a healthy plant-based diet. This means it’s both possible and practical to not consume animal products. Therefore the production of animal products is unecessary and animal suffering is unecessary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reality is however, that most people just don’t care about the well-being of animals. Most people love the way they taste more than they think their life is worth.&lt;/strong&gt; So how did I start caring?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-changed-my-mind&quot;&gt;What changed my mind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started in 2007 when I attended a bullfight in Spain and it was the first time I can remember giving serious thought to the well-being of animals. Just imagine being the bull for a minute in this scenario…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/vegan-bull-crowd.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/vegan-bull-crowd.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;assets/images/vegan-bull-crowd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The beginning of a bullfight in Spain&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The beginning of a bullfight in Spain&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re forced into a stadium and paraded around to entertain the spectators. Then you start getting stabbed with spears repeatedly. With each piercing comes tremendous pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/vegan-bull-stab.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/vegan-bull-stab.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;assets/images/vegan-bull-stab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The bull is repeatedly stabbed by spears with red, decorative hilts&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The bull is repeatedly stabbed by spears with red, decorative hilts&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several spears are sticking out of your body, you lose the strength to run. It’s at this moment a sword is thrust into your neck and you’re killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/vegan-bull-death.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/vegan-bull-death.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;assets/images/vegan-bull-death.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Once the bull is too weak to offer the matador a challenge, a final, fatal blow is delivered&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Once the bull is too weak to offer the matador a challenge, a final, fatal blow is delivered&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As I was watching this bull writhe in pain, I was struck emotionally. What was the point? For our entertainment? Because it’s culture? It was barbaric.&lt;/strong&gt; It was this experience, and many others throughout the years (from books, movies and TV, YouTube videos, conversations), that sparked an uneasiness inside me about our relationship with animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it was in 2020, when I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/C1vW9iSpLLk&quot;&gt;Alex O’Connor’s video “The Meat Eater’s Case for Veganism”&lt;/a&gt; that flipped me from being somewhat interested in the ethics of how we treat animals to all of a sudden trying to find the best arguments against veganism to refute Alex’s points. I didn’t find any then and I have yet to find any now. I knew at that moment I had to become vegan, because I was convinced it was immoral to eat animals and I had no excuse not be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-you-should-care&quot;&gt;Why you should care&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the other side of your carnitas bowl is a sentient being who was enslaved, abused, and ultimately had their life taken away from them without their consent. They didn’t want to die, and there is no way to kill someone humanely who doesn’t want to die.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you eat animals, you owe it to your conscience, your desire to be a good person, to fully understand how your meat is made and what these sentient beings go through before arriving on your dinner plate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most people would say veganism is extreme. But I think believing it’s not immoral for us to enslave, abuse, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://animalclock.org/&quot;&gt;kill billions of animals per year&lt;/a&gt; is the extreme position, and to abstain from that to be the sane position.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This is how humans are: We question all our beliefs, except for the ones that we really believe in, and those we never think to question.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;counter-arguments&quot;&gt;Counter arguments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is just my introduction to the vegan argument, I didn’t want to go deeper than I already have. However, it can’t be ignored that there are plenty of good and interesting counterpoints to the argument that we have a moral obligation to be vegan, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“It’s a personal choice what we eat.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Animals are inferior and don’t have the same moral worth as humans so killing them for food is not immoral.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“We’ve been eating animals for thousands of years. It’s the natural food chain.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“It’s not immoral if they’re killed humanely, which is more painless than how they would probably be killed in nature.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“We’re biologically made to eat meat and we need meat in a balanced diet to live a healthy life.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to address some of these and others in upcoming writings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Reggie Paquette</name></author><category term="[&quot;all&quot;]" /><summary type="html">It’s been almost three years since I stopped eating or buying anything made from animals because I became convinced it’s unethical.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/vegan.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/vegan.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Options Trading 101: Options Explained in Plain English</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/trading-stock-options-101-beginners" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Options Trading 101: Options Explained in Plain English" /><published>2020-04-12T05:02:48-07:00</published><updated>2020-04-12T05:02:48-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/trading-stock-options-101-beginners</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/trading-stock-options-101-beginners">&lt;p&gt;Stock options are just like coupons. And if you know how to use a coupon, you’ll know how trading stock options work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stock-options-101-how-options-work&quot;&gt;Stock Options 101: How Options Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain how options work, let’s start with looking at something you’re already familiar with - a coupon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this one for example - get ten-piece nuggets for $1.99 before March 15, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--full gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/basics-stock-options-tendies.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/basics-stock-options-tendies.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;assets/images/basics-stock-options-tendies.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Coupons are exactly like stock options&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Coupons are exactly like stock options&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although coupons are free, options are not. You have to buy them. I’ll cover more on this later so for now, just assume you bought this coupon for $0.50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with this coupon, you have the choice to buy ten-piece nuggets at a guaranteed price of $1.99 before March 15th, but you don’t have to use it if you don’t want to. You have the &lt;em&gt;option&lt;/em&gt; to, but not the obligation. This coupon has essentially the same makeup as a stock option:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ten-piece nuggets are the &lt;strong&gt;underlying asset&lt;/strong&gt;, the thing which you have an option to buy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$1.99 is what’s called the &lt;strong&gt;strike price&lt;/strong&gt;, the price you and the seller &lt;em&gt;struck&lt;/em&gt; a deal on&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;March 15, 2020 is the &lt;strong&gt;expiration date&lt;/strong&gt;, the last day you have the option available to use it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The $0.50 you paid for the coupon is called the &lt;strong&gt;premium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An investor would buy this coupon if they think the price of chicken will go up before the expiration date so they can buy ten-piece nuggets at a guaranteed price of $1.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say there’s been a global chicken shortage and now the cost for ten-piece nuggets went up from $1.99 ($2 for simplicity’s sake) to $6. Now the investor can &lt;strong&gt;exercise&lt;/strong&gt; their option to use the coupon and buy ten-piece nuggets for the $2 price and resell them on the open market for $6. After factoring in the premium paid of the coupon ($0.50), the investor profited $3.50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if instead veganism has taken over and now ten-piece nuggets only cost $1? Since the investor could now buy ten-piece nuggets for $1 on the open market, they have no reason to use the coupon to buy them for $2. This makes the coupon worthless. In this scenario, the investor wouldn’t exercise their option to use the coupon and their loss is only the $0.50 premium they paid for the coupon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options, at their core, are really this simple. Although they can get more complex when it comes to buying, selling, and using them in various investment strategies, they aren’t impossible to understand. Let’s leave behind the coupon analogy and now look at the two different types of option contracts and their makeup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-an-options-contract&quot;&gt;What is an Options Contract?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An options contract is an agreement that gives the purchaser an option to buy or sell a stock at a later date at a predetermined price. The agreement is always between two parties, a buyer (a.k.a. the holder or owner) and a seller (a.k.a. the writer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expiration date is when the option expires. When you’re the buyer, you can exercise an option on or before the expiration date. When you’re the seller, you can be &lt;strong&gt;assigned&lt;/strong&gt; to fulfill your obligation of the contract on or before the expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only two main types of option contracts, call options and put options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call options&lt;/strong&gt;, or “calls” for short, give the buyer the right to &lt;em&gt;call&lt;/em&gt; the underlying asset away from the option seller and buy it at a predetermined price up to a predetermined date. An investor purchases a call option contract when they think the price of the underlying asset will &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; in value beyond the agreed upon strike price before the expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put options&lt;/strong&gt;, or “puts” for short, give the buyer the right to &lt;em&gt;put&lt;/em&gt; the underlying asset up for sale and sell it to the option seller at a predetermined price up to a predetermined date. An investor purchases a put option contract when they think the price of the underlying asset will &lt;em&gt;decrease&lt;/em&gt; in value beyond the the agreed upon strike price before the expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both call and put options are contracts that give the buyer &lt;em&gt;the right&lt;/em&gt; to buy or sell the underlying asset, and not &lt;em&gt;the obligation&lt;/em&gt; to do so. Therefore, the seller of the contract is giving up &lt;em&gt;their right&lt;/em&gt; and control. So what’s in it for the seller? Since the option contract has value, the buyer has to pay the seller for it. This payment is called the &lt;strong&gt;premium&lt;/strong&gt;. The price for the underlying asset that the two parties agreed upon is called the &lt;strong&gt;strike price&lt;/strong&gt; because that’s the price they “struck” a deal on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ways-to-exit-an-options-trade&quot;&gt;Ways to exit an options trade&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the underlying asset’s value moves &lt;em&gt;in favor&lt;/em&gt; of the option buyer before the expiration date, they can sell the option contract itself to another buyer at a higher premium for a profit. At expiration, if the price of the underlying asset has moved beyond the strike price (this is called &lt;strong&gt;in the money&lt;/strong&gt;), they can exercise their option of the contract to buy the underlying asset at the strike price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the underlying asset’s value moves &lt;em&gt;out of favor&lt;/em&gt; of the buyer before expiration, they can sell the option at a lower premium for a loss or continue to hold it to see if the underlying asset’s value changes to be in their favor in time for expiration. If at expiration the value of the underlying asset is still below the strike price (this is called &lt;strong&gt;out of the money&lt;/strong&gt;), the buyer can let the option contract expire worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The option seller (the contract writer) can also sell the contract to another investor to close their position before expiration. At expiration, if the option is in the money, they will still be able to keep the premium but they will be assigned to buy or sell (depends on the option they wrote) the underlying asset. If the option is out of the money, their position is automatically closed and their capital is no longer at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are three ways to close out an options trade:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prior to expiration, you can buy or sell the contract itself to close your position (for profit or loss)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prior to or at expiration, the buyer can exercise their option in which the seller would get assigned&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;at expiration, the buyer can let the contract expire worthless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll discuss closing an options trade in more detail in a future article about option contract pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-read-an-options-contract&quot;&gt;How to Read an Options Contract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you know how option contracts work and their makeup, you can now learn to “read” an option. Here’s an example of an options contract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SPY MARCH 15 ’20 $260 CALL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPY&lt;/strong&gt; is the ticker for the underlying asset, in this case the S&amp;amp;P 500 ETF&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARCH 15 ’20&lt;/strong&gt; is the expiration date&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$260&lt;/strong&gt; is the strike price&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call&lt;/strong&gt; is the type of option, in this case a call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every broker is different and may display the elements of an options contract in different orders and formats, but they are all generally the same. Sometimes you will see an option in shorthand that can look confusing, but it’s all the same information, just more compact. For example, this is the same option as above but for a put instead of a call:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SPY051520P220&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPY&lt;/strong&gt; is the ticker, &lt;strong&gt;051520&lt;/strong&gt; is the expiration date (5/15/2020), &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt; is the option type (in this case a put, or could be &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; for call), and &lt;strong&gt;220&lt;/strong&gt; is the strike price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-trade-option-contracts-instead-of-stocks-directly&quot;&gt;Why Trade Option Contracts Instead of Stocks Directly?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With trading stocks (or any equity), you have limited leverage and flexibility. For the most part, you can only &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; a stock or &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; a stock. With trading options, you have much more leverage and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look first at how an option provides more leverage. &lt;strong&gt;A single options contract (almost) always controls 100 shares of the underlying asset.&lt;/strong&gt; So in other words, you can control 100 shares for the price of the option’s premium without having to buy 100 shares of the stock outright. For example, SPY is currently trading at $240. You could buy 100 shares outright for $24,000 or you could buy one call option contract for a fraction of the price, which could be anywhere from, say, $400 to upwards of $1,000 depending on the strike price and expiration. Or, you can invest $24,000 to buy 40 call option contracts with a $6 premium ($600 total per contract) to instead control 4,000 shares of SPY worth $960,000. This is how options provide more leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of flexibility, trading stocks is one directional, up or down, and your profit and loss is directly tied 1:1 with the stock. Here is the profit and loss payoff chart for going long on a stock and shorting a stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/short-stock-payoff-diagram.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;

        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Payoff diagrams for buying and shorting a stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you buy a stock (a.k.a. go “long”), you profit when the stock’s price increases and incur a loss when the stock’s price decreases. When you short a stock, you profit when the stock’s price decreases and incur a loss when the stock’s price increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are the payoff charts for buying and selling a call option contract and buying and selling a put option contract.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Payoff diagrams for buying and selling call and put option contracts&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice immediately the differences. Each of the above option strategies either have a limit to how much loss you can incur or a limit to how much profit you can gain. Behind the scenes, they each have their own levels of risk and probability of making a profit to tolerate with these limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying and selling call or put option contracts are just scratching the surface, too. By combining different types of options with different strike prices, you can create unique option strategies to profit in any kind of market movement. Here’s some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-4&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Payoff diagrams for various advanced option strategies&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry about these for now. Just understand that with options, you have the ability to limit both profit and loss in a single trade, profit if there is little movement in an equity, or profit if there is a lot of movement regardless if it’s up or down. This is how options provide more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-read-the-options-chain&quot;&gt;How to Read the Options Chain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull up a stock or ETF and you should see a link for “options.” Clicking this will take you to what’s called the &lt;strong&gt;options chain&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a scary looking table full of numbers you won’t understand. But don’t worry, here’s how to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each broker will display their options chain differently, but they will all have the same essential information, and some will offer more. Here’s an example of options chain from E*Trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/basics-stock-options-option-chain.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/basics-stock-options-option-chain.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;assets/images/basics-stock-options-option-chain.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of a simple options chain (from E*Trade)&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Example of a simple options chain (from E*Trade)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pulled up the options chain for the symbol &lt;strong&gt;SPY&lt;/strong&gt; as indicated in the top left and the type of options chain we’re looking at is the default &lt;strong&gt;Calls &amp;amp; Puts&lt;/strong&gt; chain (don’t worry about the others for now). In the next section is some standard quote information and immediately below that is where the information for the options chain begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The option chains are divided into different sections by the various &lt;strong&gt;expiration dates&lt;/strong&gt; shown as tabs. You’ll see I have &lt;em&gt;April 9 ’20&lt;/em&gt; selected. Clicking on the various expiration dates will change the data in the table beneath it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each row in this table is an individual options contract you can buy or sell. Splitting the table down the middle is the &lt;strong&gt;strike price&lt;/strong&gt; column. By default, option chains will show a certain number of available contracts with a strike price below and above the current price of the underlying asset (again, SPY in this case). The current price of SPY at the time of this screenshot is $272 as seen in the quote section. You can change which strike prices are shown by entering a desired strike price at the top in the “Near” box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left side of the strike price column in the table are &lt;strong&gt;call option contracts&lt;/strong&gt; and to the right of the strike price are &lt;strong&gt;put option contracts&lt;/strong&gt;. Since the current price of SPY is $272, all the call option contracts with a strike price below $272 are shaded blue because they are &lt;strong&gt;in the money&lt;/strong&gt; (often abbreviated as ITM). You can see the same thing on the right side for put option contracts with strike prices above $272. Contracts that are not shaded blue are considered &lt;strong&gt;out of the money&lt;/strong&gt; (OTM). When an option contract’s strike price is the same as the underlying asset’s current price (or within a few cents), it’s considered an &lt;strong&gt;at the money&lt;/strong&gt; option (ATM). ITM, ATM, and OTM are the three types of &lt;strong&gt;option moneyness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the table you’ll see lots of numbers. Here’s the breakdown of each column:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Interest&lt;/strong&gt; is the total number of these contracts that are currently active and open&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vol&lt;/strong&gt;, short for volume, is the number of these contracts that were opened just today&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change&lt;/strong&gt; is today’s price (premium) movement of that contract since the closing price of the previous trading day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last&lt;/strong&gt; is the price (also called the &lt;strong&gt;mark&lt;/strong&gt;) of the contract’s last completed transaction, whether opened or closed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bid&lt;/strong&gt; is the current maximum price buyers are willing to pay for that contract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask&lt;/strong&gt; is the current minimum price sellers are willing sell that contract for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a more advanced options chain table from Power E*Trade, their more advanced options trading platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/basics-stock-options-advanced-options-chain.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/basics-stock-options-advanced-options-chain.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;assets/images/basics-stock-options-advanced-options-chain.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of the options chain from a more advanced broker (from Power E*Trade)&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Example of the options chain from a more advanced broker (from Power E*Trade)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me first point out these options chains are &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; looking at call option contracts - notice the strike price column is not in the middle anymore but all the way to the right. That’s because with more advanced option trading platforms, you can hide one side or the other to see more columns of information for a contract all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these options chains look completely different on the surface, it’s still mostly the same information. Take a minute to compare this screenshot to the previous one and try to spot what’s the same and what’s new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first difference you might notice is I’ve selected multiple expiration dates, &lt;em&gt;Apr-09-20&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Apr-15-20&lt;/em&gt; and you can see both option chains displayed below at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a breakdown of the data in the new columns in the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bid Size&lt;/strong&gt; is the number of contracts buyers have placed buy orders for that are waiting to be filled at the current bid price&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask Size&lt;/strong&gt; is the number of contracts sellers have placed sell orders for that are waiting to be filled at the current ask price&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delta&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Gamma&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Theta&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Vega&lt;/strong&gt; (along with &lt;strong&gt;Rho&lt;/strong&gt; which isn’t shown) are referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;Greeks&lt;/strong&gt; and I’m going to cover this in another article - don’t worry about them for now&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implied Volatility&lt;/strong&gt; or IV is a measurement of how volatile the price of that contract is&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prob ITM Exp ATM IV&lt;/strong&gt; is the probability that contract will be ITM at it’s expiration date (this is calculated using the IV from the same expiration date contract that’s currently ATM)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intrinsic Value&lt;/strong&gt; is the dollar value worth per contract if it expired right now. Only contracts ITM have an intrinsic value greater than 0&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extrinsic Value&lt;/strong&gt; is the dollar value worth per contract investors give an option based on its profit potential at expiration that has not yet been realized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-buy-to-open-an-option-trade&quot;&gt;How to Buy to Open an Option Trade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you can buy to open an options contract, you will need to get option approval from your brokerage. How to accomplish this is different with each broker, but should be easy to figure out. There are typically four levels of option access, with each level permitting different types of option strategies. Apply for at least level two. Your broker will tell you what each level grants access to. Once you submit your request, it may take a few trading days to be approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various ways for each broker to &lt;em&gt;open a new position&lt;/em&gt; for an options contract, but you can most likely click a contract’s ask price to buy it or the bid price to write (sell) it. Here’s what it looks like in Power E*Trade to buy the April 15th $268 contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--full gtc-1&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Example of an option order window (from Power E*Trade)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;at the very top, confirm you have the right account selected&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;below that, confirm the symbol is correct, in this case SPY&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;confirm whether you want to buy or write the option using the &lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt; toggle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;select the number of contracts you want to buy under &lt;strong&gt;Qty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;confirm your &lt;strong&gt;Expiration&lt;/strong&gt; date is correct&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;confirm your &lt;strong&gt;Strike&lt;/strong&gt; price is correct&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price Type&lt;/strong&gt; let’s you choose how you want your order executed, I recommend to always use limit to secure your desired price&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set your desired price under &lt;strong&gt;Limit Price&lt;/strong&gt;. To the right, you can see the bid and ask price for the contract change in real time as you’re placing your order&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set how long you want your order to stay open under &lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set whether you want your order to process only if it can buy or write all the contracts at your limit price under &lt;strong&gt;Special Handling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After everything looks correct, clicking the &lt;strong&gt;Preview&lt;/strong&gt; button will allow you to do one final confirmation of your trade before placing an order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-sell-to-close-an-option-trade&quot;&gt;How to Sell to Close an Option Trade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close an open position, go to your open positions list in your broker and find the position you want to close. There should be a &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; button or link when you hover over it or select it. This is the best way, at least for me, to ensure you’re closing a position, instead of &lt;em&gt;selling to open&lt;/em&gt; a new position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s an overview of what options are, how they work, why options can be a useful instrument for investors, and how to open and close an option trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make your own copy by clicking the link below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The template is based off the principles and concepts from Ramit Sethi’s personal finance book, &lt;em&gt;“I Will Teach You to Be Rich.”&lt;/em&gt; I’ll cover everything you need to know in this post, but if you want to learn more about it, you can read my summary of the book below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-makes-this-google-sheets-budget-template-better-than-the-others-out-there&quot;&gt;What Makes This Google Sheets Budget Template Better Than The Others Out There&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;all-the-setup-is-on-one-page&quot;&gt;All the setup is on one page&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just one configuration tab, you’ll fill out all your info: income, account names, budget, etc. All the other tabs pull data from this &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab so you never have to enter in any information twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-one-page-settings.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-one-page-settings.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-one-page-settings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Once you set up this Config tab, just enter expenses and account balances. That's it!&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Once you set up this Config tab, just enter expenses and account balances. That's it!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;built-in-guided-setup&quot;&gt;Built-in guided setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening up a new Google Sheets budget template with all these numbers and tabs can be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I wanted to create a guided setup to make it super simple for anyone to get started. When you open up the template, you’ll be greeted with easy-to-follow prompts so you know exactly what you need to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;assets/videos/guided-tour.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Bright orange prompts make this the easiest Google Sheets budget template to get set up on.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setup-checklist&quot;&gt;Setup checklist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the configuration settings, the checklist shows you where to go next in the template to enter your expenses and account balances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-setup-checklist.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-setup-checklist.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-setup-checklist.png&quot; alt=&quot;The setup checklist will automatically mark things complete as you finish each step.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The setup checklist will automatically mark things complete as you finish each step.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one-dashboard-to-rule-them-all&quot;&gt;One dashboard to rule them all&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Google Sheets budget template has four tabs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; - the main tab where you can see your spending vs budget for the current month and analyze previous months’ spending. All the data is pulled from the other tabs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expenses&lt;/strong&gt; - where you enter all your expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt; - to record your bank account, retirement account, credit card and loan balances, etc. This data is used to help measure whether your net worth is increasing or shrinking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; - as explained above, this is where you fill out your income, name your accounts, and set your budgets, which is used in all the other tabs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll spend most of your time in the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;The dashboard is the clearest way to see where you're spending your money.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The dashboard is the clearest way to see where you're spending your money.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;always-know-how-much-of-your-monthly-budget-you-have-left&quot;&gt;Always know how much of your monthly budget you have left&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you fill out your expenses, there’s a “module” where you can see exactly how much of a budget category you’ve used so far in the current month and know exactly how much you have left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve overspent in one budget category, the template will let you take remaining budget from another category to cover it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;assets/videos/budget-module.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;This makes it fun to fill out your expenses everyday and it's easy to temporarily take budget from another category to cover one you've overspent in.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;budget-and-keep-track-of-annual-irregular-expenses&quot;&gt;Budget and keep track of annual, irregular expenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The template is also built to accommodate irregular expenses that you might only spend money on or have to pay for a few times a year. Once you enter a list of the things you want to create an annual budget for, the template will calculate how much you need to save per month to cover it. And that amount is deducted before you set up your monthly budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget-module.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget-module.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget-module.png&quot; alt=&quot;This template helps you plan for irregular or annual expenses.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;This template helps you plan for irregular or annual expenses.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spend-your-money-without-feeling-guilty&quot;&gt;Spend your money without feeling guilty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call the monthly budget the &lt;em&gt;“guilt-free budget,”&lt;/em&gt; which is a concept taken from the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://regpaq.com/i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I Will Teach You to Be Rich.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Since the budget template is built to help you put aside money for savings before creating your monthly budget, it means you don’t ever have to feel guilty about spending the money you do have left over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a fundamental shift in my perspective about personal finance Ramit calls &lt;em&gt;paying yourself first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-guilt-free-budget.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-guilt-free-budget.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-guilt-free-budget.png&quot; alt=&quot;After budgeting money for savings and annual expenses, you can budget your discretionary spending, guilt-free.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;After budgeting money for savings and annual expenses, you can budget your discretionary spending, guilt-free.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;built-to-drive-behavioral-change&quot;&gt;Built to drive behavioral change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my friends use a budgeting app like Mint and I’ve tried them, too. But these apps don’t really help me spend less money - they just tell me where I spend my money and try to guess (poorly) the category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I love budgets built on spreadsheets. I can customize it exactly the way I need to actually help me spend my money more thoughtfully. On less of things I care little about, and more on the things I care a lot about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A bad budget system only shows you where your money is going. A good budget system will create a change in your behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FyZvG4UI11Kd-kaVPpUiV5mRjgPz4OERfxak_KXCsgU/copy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;budget_download&quot;&gt;try my Google Sheets budget template&lt;/a&gt;, make a copy of it and try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are simple and clear instructions with extra notes on cells that have an asterisk(*) - just hover over those cells to the see note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re stuck and need more info to get going, read on to get the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-use-my-google-sheets-budget-template&quot;&gt;How to Use My Google Sheets Budget Template&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start on the &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, cells with an asterisk(*) mean there is a note on that cell with more information. Hover over it to see what it says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-enter-your-income&quot;&gt;I. Enter your income&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the top left box on the &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab, enter your income. Follow the orange colored cells as cues for which part to fill out next. If you don’t &lt;strong&gt;contribute to a 401k&lt;/strong&gt; or typically receive any &lt;strong&gt;extra monthly income&lt;/strong&gt;, enter $0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-income.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-income.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-income.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enter your income data in the Income Breakdown box on the Dashbord tab&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Enter your income data in the Income Breakdown box on the Dashbord tab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This budget template is only made for two sources of income. If you have more than one additional source of income, you can count them together and enter the total as one number for your &lt;strong&gt;extra monthly income&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All income entered here will be available for your budget. Before leaving the &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab, you’ll be able to choose how much of it will go into savings, additional retirement accounts, loans, etc, but first you have to name your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-name-your-accounts&quot;&gt;II. Name your accounts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to give a &lt;strong&gt;nickname&lt;/strong&gt; for every type of bank account, asset, and liability you have. The &lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt; is very important to formulas in in the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt; tabs and cannot be changed. If you don’t have an account with the listed &lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt;, leave it blank and skip it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-3&quot;&gt;

            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-bank-account-names.png&quot; alt=&quot;Giving each account you have a nickname tells the budget template you have those accounts.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;

            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-asset-names.png&quot; alt=&quot;Giving each account you have a nickname tells the budget template you have those accounts.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-liability-names.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-liability-names.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-liability-names.png&quot; alt=&quot;Giving each account you have a nickname tells the budget template you have those accounts.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Giving each account you have a nickname tells the budget template you have those accounts.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have more accounts than what the &lt;strong&gt;types&lt;/strong&gt; have you can count them together as one. For example, if you have four credit cards, you can count two of them together and give &lt;strong&gt;credit card #3&lt;/strong&gt; the nickname &lt;strong&gt;Amex &amp;amp; Citi cards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-create-your-annual-budget&quot;&gt;III. Create your annual budget&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why you create your budget for annual expenses before monthly expenses is so that you’re encouraged to set aside money to be better prepared for irregular expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by adding things you pay for once a year or irregularly in the &lt;strong&gt;Annual Budget&lt;/strong&gt; box. You can find examples and suggestions by hovering over the &lt;strong&gt;budget category*&lt;/strong&gt; cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enter your annual and irregular expenses to prepare for the future.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Enter your annual and irregular expenses to prepare for the future.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you enter in all the annual and irregular expenses you can think of, the budget template will divide the &lt;strong&gt;total&lt;/strong&gt; into a monthly amount inside the &lt;strong&gt;Fixed Monthly Costs&lt;/strong&gt; box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-enter-your-fixed-monthly-costs&quot;&gt;IV. Enter your fixed monthly costs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed Monthly Costs&lt;/strong&gt; are recurring monthly expenses that you don’t expect to change month-to-month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the list is the monthly amount to set aside for your &lt;strong&gt;annual budget&lt;/strong&gt; and the second item is your &lt;strong&gt;after tax retirement&lt;/strong&gt; account. If you have one and gave it a nickname in the &lt;strong&gt;Asset Names&lt;/strong&gt; box, the nickname will be used for this line item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have one or don’t plan on contributing to the one you do have, enter $0 for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-fixed-monthly-costs.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-fixed-monthly-costs.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-fixed-monthly-costs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enter your fixed monthly costs.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Enter your fixed monthly costs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is room for eight additional fixed monthly costs. There are suggestions in the note on the &lt;strong&gt;budget category*&lt;/strong&gt; cell. Along with budgeting for annual expenses and retirement, I highly recommend setting more money aside for extra savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;em&gt;pay yourself first&lt;/em&gt; concept described in &lt;em&gt;“I Will Teach You to Be Rich.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The goal [of pay yourself first] is to make sure that enough income is first saved or invested before monthly expenses or discretionary purchases are made.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payyourselffirst.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Investopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you’re left with your &lt;strong&gt;total for guilt-free budget&lt;/strong&gt;, which is how much you have left for discretionary spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-create-your-guilt-free-monthly-budget&quot;&gt;IV. Create your guilt-free, monthly budget&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained earlier, it’s called your guilt-free budget because this is what is left over after setting money aside for savings, retiremenet, and future annual expenses. This is your money to spend however you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Guilt-Free Budget&lt;/strong&gt; box, enter categories of expenses and an allotted amount. Again, there are suggestions in the note on the &lt;strong&gt;budget category*&lt;/strong&gt; cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-guilt-free-budget.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-guilt-free-budget.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-guilt-free-budget.png&quot; alt=&quot;After budgeting money for savings and annual expenses, you can budget your discretionary spending, guilt-free.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;After budgeting money for savings and annual expenses, you can budget your discretionary spending, guilt-free.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve budgeted over what you have available in your &lt;strong&gt;total for guilt-free budget&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;Fixed Monthly Costs&lt;/strong&gt; box, this &lt;strong&gt;total&lt;/strong&gt; number will turn red and. The number below the &lt;strong&gt;total&lt;/strong&gt; number is how much you have left from your &lt;strong&gt;guilt-free budget&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your monthly and annual budget is now set up! The next step is setting up the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-setting-up-the-balance-sheet&quot;&gt;V. Setting up the balance sheet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going deep into the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;, you just need to enter your start date in the orange cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start date is the first of a month, current or in the past, written as &lt;em&gt;“1/1/2020”&lt;/em&gt;. Once you enter your start date, it will reformat to &lt;em&gt;“Jan ‘20”&lt;/em&gt; and fill the rest of the range for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;assets/videos/dates-on-balance-sheet.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Write the start date in the format of 1/1/2020.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more to do here, but it makes sense to first record your expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-how-to-record-expenses&quot;&gt;V. How to record expenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Expenses&lt;/strong&gt; tab you’ll record your monthly and annual expenses - one row per one expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest presumable downsides of doing your budget in Google Sheets is you have to enter in your expenses manually, but this is a blessing in disguise. Entering your expenses manually has a big and positive psychological effect on your spending behavior. It makes you “feel the pain” of every dollar you spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Manually recording your expenses every week will force you to review every transaction, to feel the pain of every dollar spent, and make you think “was that really necessary?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is you can easily split an expense into two different budget categories, which I’ve found helpful many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;assets/videos/entering-expenses.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Example of how fast you can enter expenses by using the 'tab' and 'enter' keys&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the heading, you’ll see your &lt;strong&gt;guilt-free budget&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;annual budget&lt;/strong&gt; categories from the &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab. When you enter an expense, start with the date in &lt;strong&gt;column a&lt;/strong&gt;, the name of the place you spend the money in &lt;strong&gt;column b&lt;/strong&gt;, and then tab over to the column with the right budget category for that expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and enter all your expenses beginning from the start date you entered on the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t enter expenses or transfers you already accounted for in the &lt;strong&gt;Fixed Monthly Costs&lt;/strong&gt; box on the &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vi-filling-out-the-balance-sheet&quot;&gt;VI. Filling out the balance sheet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once at the beginning of every month you’ll fill out the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt; tab for the previous month. This is where you will add up all the money you have and owe in your accounts so you can see if your wealth and net worth are increasing or shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before moving on, make sure the first three items are marked complete in the &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; checklist on the &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet’s&lt;/strong&gt; sidebar, you’ll see the accounts you’ve named on the &lt;strong&gt;Config&lt;/strong&gt; tab. At the beginning of the month when you fill this out, you’ll enter the balances of each account in the previous month’s column. For example, if I was filling this out today on February 7th, I’d enter the balances under the &lt;strong&gt;Jan ‘20&lt;/strong&gt; column. So if you’re starting date is the first of this month, you don’t have to fill out anything until the month is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You only need to enter balances in the white rows. You can skip the greyed out columns (don’t delete them) and don’t overwrite anything with a &lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; in the cell. The dashes indicate a placeholder for a formula and will populate if and when it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--vwide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enter the previous months' ending balances in each row for the indicated month.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Enter the previous months' ending balances in each row for the indicated month.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Liabilities&lt;/strong&gt; section, you’ll do the same thing as you do with your bank accounts but for your rent/mortgage, loans, and credit cards. If you don’t have a mortgage, enter $0 for the &lt;strong&gt;rent&lt;/strong&gt;. Rent is paid on the 1st of the month so by the end of the month, which these totals are representing, you don’t owe anymore rent. So actually, &lt;strong&gt;rent&lt;/strong&gt; should be $0 for every month in the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you pay a mortgage, then you can enter the mortgage payoff amount in the &lt;strong&gt;mortgage&lt;/strong&gt; row. I do the same with my &lt;strong&gt;car loan&lt;/strong&gt;. When filling out your credit card balances, make sure any pending credit card payments are already reflected in your bank account balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-liabilities.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-liabilities.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-liabilities.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of the Liabilities section with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Example of the Liabilities section with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Monthly Expenses&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Annual Expenses&lt;/strong&gt; sections automatically sum your expenses for that month for each budget category. You can analyze this easier in the the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-expenses.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-expenses.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-expenses.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of the Monthly and Annual Expenses secions with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Example of the Monthly and Annual Expenses secions with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last section is the &lt;strong&gt;Totals&lt;/strong&gt; section, which brings everything together to calculate your &lt;strong&gt;net checking balance&lt;/strong&gt; (money in checking minus current credit card balances) and your &lt;strong&gt;net worth&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last row you can leave notes for yourself if something noteworthy occurred that you might want to come back to. The word “Notes” will auto populate in each month, but to leave an actual note, right-click the &lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt; cell and select “Insert note.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-totals.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-balance-sheet-totals.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;

        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Example of the Totals section with sample data on the Balance Sheet tab.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s all you need to do on the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt; tab. As you use this Google Sheets budget template each month, more data on the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; tab will start to populate and be more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vii-using-the-dashboard&quot;&gt;VII. Using the dashboard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to the best part - the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;. This is where you can see the most useful insights for your budget. Except for a small part that I’ll explain below, everything on the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; is automated and you shouldn’t have to change anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top is an &lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt; box with just a few pieces of information to get your overall personal finance health. It’s updated every time a month is filled out on the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt; so if your start date is the first of the current month, you won’t see anything here yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-overview.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-overview.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-overview.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Overview box on the Dashbord tab shows your personal finance health from a bird's eye view.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The Overview box on the Dashbord tab shows your personal finance health from a bird's eye view.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the right of your &lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt; box is a graph of your &lt;strong&gt;Net Worth&lt;/strong&gt; growth. This is pulling the last seven months of data from the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--thin gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-net-worth.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-net-worth.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-net-worth.png&quot; alt=&quot;Visualize the grow of your net worth over time.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Visualize the grow of your net worth over time.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is my favorite part of the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;This Month’s Budget Spent So Far*&lt;/strong&gt; box. This shows how your spending is doing for the current month compared to your budget for each category. Since I update my &lt;strong&gt;Expenses&lt;/strong&gt; tab every morning, I can see my updated budget here every day so I know exactly how much of my budget I have left for each category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;assets/videos/budget-module.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;This makes it fun to fill out your expenses everyday and it's easy to temporarily take budget from another category to cover one you overspent in.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you overspent in one category, you can subtract &lt;strong&gt;Remaining&lt;/strong&gt; budget from another budget category by subtracting an amount from it in the &lt;strong&gt;Cut Remaining*&lt;/strong&gt; column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the same module for annual expenses below the monthly one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget-module.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget-module.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-annual-budget-module.png&quot; alt=&quot;Always know exactly how much of your budget you have left of your annual budget for each category.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Always know exactly how much of your budget you have left of your annual budget for each category.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the monthly and the annual &lt;strong&gt;Budget Spent So Far&lt;/strong&gt; boxes will update automatically every month and year respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is the &lt;strong&gt;Spent vs Budget Previous 7 Months*&lt;/strong&gt; box. This is a dynamic graph that compares your spending to your budget for each category. Use the dropdown selector in the top right of the box to look at a specific budget category or look at the total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;video muted=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;assets/videos/spent-vs-budget.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The Spent vs Budget box on the Dashbord tab visualizes your spending for each category.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this graph is only looking at the previous seven completed months. It doesn’t take into account the current months’s spending because it’s not over yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last on the &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; tab is the &lt;strong&gt;Expenses Table Previous 7 Months*&lt;/strong&gt; box. This provides the same data as the graph above, but in a table format. Amounts will turn red if you overspent your budget in that category that month. This is a great way to quickly see how you’re doing staying under budget at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-expense-table.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-expense-table.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/google-sheets-budget-template-dashboard-expense-table.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Expenses Last 7 Months box shows a table of your spending vs your budget for each category.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The Expenses Last 7 Months box shows a table of your spending vs your budget for each category.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-budgeting-tips&quot;&gt;Bonus Budgeting Tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A budget is only good if you update it consistently, keep it accurate, and spend time analyzing your spending. That’s why I made it a point to make this budget template in Google Sheets look nice, be easy to use, and be rewarding to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes that’s still not enough. &lt;strong&gt;There’s definitely been times where I don’t do it for a few weeks at a time and the more you wait, the more work you’ll have to do, and the more you won’t look forward to doing it&lt;/strong&gt;. I‘ve made it a habit to enter my expenses every morning instead of once a week or month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe a budget will help you get control of your spending, read this guide on how to stick to new habits:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tip is to use a credit card for all transactions when possible. Using a credit card makes it much easier to keep track of your spending and at the same time protects your bank account from fraud, builds your credit, and you can earn points and rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most marketers default to using Google Analytics for every website. It’s free, powerful, and the industry standard. Why try anything else, &lt;em&gt;right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-wanted-an-alternative-to-google-analytics&quot;&gt;Why I Wanted an Alternative to Google Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s three reasons I wanted something different than Google Analytics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It adds load time to a website&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It uses cookies and requires a GDPR notice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It tracks users for Google’s own data gain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When rebuilding this site from scratch, one of my big focuses was on speed.&lt;/strong&gt; Since I was using Netlify to host and deploy my site from GitHub, I first tried their server-side analytics called &lt;a href=&quot;/netlify-analytics-review&quot;&gt;Netlify Analytics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netlify Analytics is cool because it tracks users on the server side vs the client side. That means it adds zero weight and load time to a website, doesn’t use cookies, and doesn’t track users. &lt;em&gt;Great!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the product isn’t nearly detailed enough to offer any actionable insights, especially at $9/month as I explained in my review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;rec-art&quot; aria-label=&quot;Recommended Article&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/netlify-analytics-review&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;rec-img&quot;&gt;
                &lt;figure&gt;
                    &lt;picture&gt;

                    &lt;/picture&gt;
                &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;        
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So still interested in other analytics platforms, I heard about Fathom through Twitter. Although it’s not server-side analytics, it is cookie-less and doesn’t add much more load time than Google Analytics does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of Fathom started in 2018 from a tweet by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pjrvs/&quot;&gt;Paul Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; who asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What if website analytics software didn’t take your users data to line their pockets for advertising?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paul Jarvis&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the idea behind this.&lt;/strong&gt; But a problem I couldn’t deal with when switching to Netlify Analytics was, as a marketer, not being able to take away enough actionable insights to improve my content and website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would Fathom Analytics be any different? &lt;strong&gt;Because I don’t want to pay for vanity metrics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is Fathom Analytics more expensive than Netlify Analytics, but it will add to my website’s load time. If I’m going to have to pay more and deal with the load time, it will have to be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So far, I’ve been using and paying for Fathom for seven months now and here’s what I think of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-review-of-fathom-analytics-can-it-replace-google-analytics-for-marketers&quot;&gt;My Review of Fathom Analytics: Can it Replace Google Analytics for Marketers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fathom analytics has two types of customers: personal blogs (like this website), and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For personal blogs, the message is simple: Google is kind of a bully and you don’t want to give them data on all your users. And their analytics is complicated to use. So here’s an analytics platform that just gives you the data you need and keeps your user data private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For businesses (and marketers), it’s a different story. We actually know how to use Google Analytics and rely on that data to help drive our SEO, content, and website strategy. &lt;strong&gt;Do most marketers care about their user privacy? Aren’t marketers the ones who are always trying to identify their users?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a much tougher sell. In my opinion, the only companies who are going to ditch Google Analytics for privacy-focused analytics like Fathom are ones with founders who already value data privacy. If they don’t, no chance in hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don’t think Paul Jarvis or his co-founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jackellis/&quot;&gt;Jack Ellis&lt;/a&gt; care. They don’t want those types of customers anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The way we run our business is ridiculously simple (not the norm in tech): we charge a fair amount of money for our product, use that money to keep the business running indefinitely, and remain small so that we don’t need a lot of money to be profitable and sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/about&quot;&gt;Fathom Analytics About Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you, as a marketer, don’t value data-privacy for your users, you’re probably not going to like Fathom Analytics. If you do, it’s then it’s the best privacy-focused analytics solution available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t decide whether you value data-privacy or tracking users more, then read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-data-can-you-see-from-fathom-analytics&quot;&gt;What Data Can You See from Fathom Analytics?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of what you get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;live, real-time data that doesn’t expire like Netlify Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;custom date range picker to filter data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;total unique visits (equivalent to sessions in Google Analytics, I think), page views, average time on site, and bounce rate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list of your site’s URLs with the percent of total and number of unique visits and page views&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/support/goals&quot;&gt;unlimited goal creation&lt;/a&gt; by link click, page load, or form submission&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list of referrers (actual page referring URL) with the percent of total and number of unique visits and page views (also shows the individual tweets sending you traffic)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;device type, browser, and country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all sounds good, but when I dug in, I found some shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-want-from-fathom-analytics&quot;&gt;What I Want From Fathom Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a few things I’d like to see built in future releases. I’m not sure if it’s possible based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/news/anonymization&quot;&gt;their way of measuring traffic&lt;/a&gt;, but if it is, I would be so happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Fathom Analytics, you can’t:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;filter traffic by referrer to see what pages are being viewed by that referring traffic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or filter traffic by device type, browser, or country (no equivalent to Google Analytics’ dimensions)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;filter metrics by looking at a one page URL at a time to see the referrers, device type, country, and goals for any given page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;see bounce rate, average time spent on site, or goal completions by page URL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or see the above by the first page URL of a unique visit (equivalent to Google Analytics’ Landing Page dimension)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these were added, this would give me about 90% of what I use Google Analytics for as a marketer and would be sufficient for a personal blog, but still don’t think it could suffice for a growth-focused company’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they can’t add these features without sacrificing user privacy, Fathom is the type of company to stand its ground and say &lt;em&gt;no.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/usefathom/fathom/issues/283&quot;&gt;Paul Jarvis already denied my request to work with AMP.&lt;/a&gt; I get it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-cool-things-you-can-do-with-fathom-analytics&quot;&gt;Other Cool Things You Can Do With Fathom Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can choose to make your analytics public if you want to have a transparent website&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They do have an affiliate program where you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/ref/W2AU06&quot;&gt;get 25% lifetime commissions and people you refer will get $10 off their first month&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They’re working on an API - I’m going to use it to display page view counts on articles for social proof&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can set up weekly and monthly reports and also set up client reports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can use it on unlimited domains and &lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/ref/W2AU06&quot;&gt;their pricing is based on total page views&lt;/a&gt; not by domain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/ref/W2AU06&quot;&gt;7-day free trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-fathom-analytics-worth-it&quot;&gt;Is Fathom Analytics Worth It?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fathom Analytics costs $14/month and right now, I do feel like I’m paying for vanity metrics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/fathom-analytics-pricing.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/fathom-analytics-pricing.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/fathom-analytics-pricing.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fathom Analytics starts at $14/month with unlimited domains.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Fathom Analytics starts at $14/month with unlimited domains.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I enjoy paying for it and using it on this site. It’s rare to come across a company that sticks to its mission which radiates in everything they do - their roadmap, design, content, and podcast. And they’re upfront about charging more than the industry standard so they can afford to stick to their principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I just love it when companies do that. And I’m a sucker for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So should you make the switch? Well it comes down to whether you can get behind the mission of the company:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Our goal is huge but simple: to make as many websites as possible black holes for data to Google.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paul Jarvis&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you vibe with that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://usefathom.com/ref/W2AU06&quot;&gt;give it a shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-april-2020&quot;&gt;Update April 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the decision to switch back to Google Analytics. Because my site isn’t big enough and I don’t write as much as I’d like to, I don’t get enough value from premium analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I enjoy what Fathom is doing, I’m going to pause for now and come back soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the fun of it, I tested the difference in my site speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Requests&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Data over network&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Resources on page&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Load time&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Fathom&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;233 KB&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;312 KB&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;623 ms&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;277 KB&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;430 KB&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;384 ms&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, Google Analytics added more weight to the page, but was quicker to load. And since I don’t have any third party embeds or sending this data to any third party websites, I still don’t need a cookie consent notice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Reggie Paquette</name></author><category term="[&quot;all&quot;]" /><summary type="html">Fathom Analytics is a cookie-less analytics platform that values user privacy above all.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/fathom-analytics-review.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/fathom-analytics-review.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">I Will Teach You to Be Rich—Summary, Notes, + Quotes</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-summary-notes-quotes" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I Will Teach You to Be Rich—Summary, Notes, + Quotes" /><published>2020-01-14T06:30:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-01-14T06:30:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-summary-notes-quotes</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich-summary-notes-quotes">&lt;p&gt;It’s unfortunate I Will Teach You To Be Rich has an off-putting title because it’s a fantastic introduction to personal finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi’s goal is to make personal finance exciting and rewarding, a stark contrast from the dry, guilt-inducing material you typically would associate to the personal finance space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He won’t blame you for spending lots of money on the things you enjoy; the same things most people would tell you is irresponsible to spend so much money on. Instead he encourages you to keep doing it unapologetically.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catch? Cut spending harder in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Spend extravagantly on the things you love, and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His refreshing approach to money comes from the idea that money shouldn’t rule our lives, and instead be a tool to help us enjoy life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, he’ll encourage financial responsibility. Yes, he’ll advocate &lt;a href=&quot;/google-sheets-budget-template&quot;&gt;using a budget&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, he’ll try to persuade you to start saving for retirement immediately. &lt;strong&gt;But what makes Ramit different is he shows you how to get this important stuff done and out of the way by automating it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes room to think about the fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why do you want to be rich?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does being rich mean to you?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to briefly cover his main recommendations from each topic, but because of his innovative approach to spending and budgeting and how practical it is, I’m going to spend a bit more time covering them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Everybody teaches you how to save. Nobody talks about how to spend.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-make-credit-cards-work-for-you&quot;&gt;How to Make Credit Cards Work for You&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section covers a lot about what a credit score is, how it’s calculated, and how credit cards work - all great for beginners. These are the notes I took for myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;always use a credit card over a debit card - builds credit, protects your bank account, accrue rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;always pay off credit cards in full each month - treat it like a debit card&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set up automatic payments so you never miss a payment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;keep old credit cards active by charging a small monthly cost to keep credit history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;switch credit cards to a no annual fee card when it’s no longer your primary card&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;request credit limit increases to improve your credit utilization rate (a factor of your credit score)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be aware of and use your rewards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can negotiate lower APRs and get late fees waived if you call and ask&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section ends with strategies to pay off credit card debt. It can be summarized by paying off debt with the highest intrest rate, but it’s more nuanced than that. If you do have credit card debt, this section is worth reading in full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-set-up-the-right-bank-accounts&quot;&gt;How to Set Up The Right Bank Accounts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m always surprised when I learn friends use traditional big banks for their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They typically have the worse benefits, have minimum balance requirements for checking accounts, and a poor online banking experience. Ramit does a good job exposing these pitfalls by explaining how banks make money and the tactics they use to lure you in and make it hard to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a couple, but important takeaways on banks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;switch to an online bank (I recommend Capital One)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open a high-yield savings accounts (Capital One has them for free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-set-up-the-right-retirement-accounts&quot;&gt;How to Set Up The Right Retirement Accounts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the most important section so far, Ramit makes it simple to understand all the different types of retirement accounts and persuasively lays out why it’s so important to start saving for retirement now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He created five systematic steps for investing he calls “The Ladder of Personal Finance.”&lt;/strong&gt; When you finish the first step, or if it’s not an option, you proceed to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;contribute 100% of what your employer matches in a company 401k&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pay off credit card or other debt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open a Roth IRA and contribute up to the annual maximum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;max out your 401k beyond or regardless of a company match&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;put the rest in a non retirement brokerage account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this section goes deep into each step of the ladder, explaining everything very clearly. I was finally able to understand the tax advantages of each different kind of retirement account and also why it was valuable to start now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-manage-spending-and-enjoy-it&quot;&gt;How to Manage Spending and Enjoy It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you can learn to how to better manage your money he says you need to understand where you’re spending it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, he doesn’t recommend creating a budget where you track your finances down to the penny, but instead do what he calls a “Conscious Spending Plan,” which still sounds an awful lot like a budget, just a little more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conscious Spending is Ramit’s method of allowing yourself to spend money on the things that bring you joy, even if they seem frivolous to other people, or even frivolous to you. In exchange, you cut the spending elsewhere. This is how Ramit defines frugality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Frugality isn’t about cutting your spending on everything. That approach wouldn’t last two days. Frugality, quite simply, is about choosing the things you love enough to spend extravagantly on - and then cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t love.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-make-a-conscious-spending-plan&quot;&gt;How to make a conscious spending plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divide up where your take home pay goes into four major buckets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Money Buckets&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Percent of take home pay to allocate&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I. Fixed Costs - Rent, utilities, debt, etc.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;50-60%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;II. Investments - 401(k), Rotha IRA&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;III. Savings - Vacations, gifts, house down payment, unexpected expenses&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5-10%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;IV. Guilt-free spending money - Dining out, drinking, movies, clothes, shoes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;20-35%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed costs are expenses you have to pay every month no matter what. Once you total them up, subtract that amount from your take-home pay.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out how much you want to save for retirement in a 401k and or IRA and then deduct that amount.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think about what you want to save for in the short and long term. Calculate how much you need to save per month to reach that goal and then deduct that amount.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After allocating money for fixed costs, retirement and investments, and savings, the rest is for guilt-free spending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/google-sheets-budget-template&quot;&gt;I made a budget template on Google Sheets&lt;/a&gt; based on Ramit’s Conscious Spending Plan that can you help do all this.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tips-to-optimize-your-conscious-spending-plan&quot;&gt;Tips to optimize your Conscious Spending Plan:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;always try to cut fixed costs and guilt-free spending before cutting how much you allocate to investing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;focus on big wins to cut spending, not small ones like buying generic brands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you’re more likely to stick to a new budget by making a gradual change than a dramatic one&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;actually write out tangible savings goals to increase motivation to achieve them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-the-envelope-system-to-target-big-wins&quot;&gt;Use the “envelope system” to target big wins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The envelope system is essentially a second bucket system for your guilt-free spending. You allocate a certain amount of your guilt-free spending to certain categories (envelopes) and once you spend all the money in that envelope, that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s much easier to figure out how much money you should put into each envelope by looking at your last three months of spending in each category, averaging them out, and then setting an achievable goal for each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a good objective to try and meet your spending goal for each category, but you can dip into other envelopes if you need to. The most important thing is keeping your total spending below what you have for guilt-free spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;activity-based-envelopes&quot;&gt;Activity based envelopes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One trick Ramit mentions that I’ve used in the past is instead of using the general categories that credit card companies and banks typically use, create categories more personal to you and &lt;em&gt;around events&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I have used these categories in the past:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;eating out alone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coffee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;alcohol for home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;going out with friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this requires a manual categorization of each expense, it will highglight the driving activities behind your spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to keep track of spending is to always use a credit card (as long as your responsible) so you can just pull up your account to enter expenses into your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The best part about setting up a strategic budget is that it guides your decisions, letting you say no much more easily - ‘Sorry, it’s not in my plan this month.’ - and freeing you up to enjoy what you do spend on. This is guilt-free spending at its best.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-automate-it-all-to-be-hands-off&quot;&gt;How to Automate It All to be Hands Off&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re contributing to a 401k, that’s probably already automated by your employer before even receiving your paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then your paycheck gets deposited into your checking account and from there you set up a monthly automatic transfer to your other retirement and savings accounts. &lt;strong&gt;By transferring the money automatically right after you get paid, you’re paying yourself first, not spending first and saving what’s left over.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s why the money left over to spend is guilt-free spending money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the flow looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;How to automate your finances. Automatically transfer to savings first. Your percentage allocation may differ.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“By setting up an automatic payment plan you actually make it difficult to stop the contributions to your retirement account! Not because you can’t - you can adjust your system any time - but because you’re lazy and you won’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ramit Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More automation tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set up all bills to be paid by credit card automatically&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if a bill (like rent) can’t be paid by card, set up auto bill pay to have your bank automtically send a check on your behalf&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set up your credit card bill to be paid automatically from your checking account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;set a reminder in the middle of the month to check how you much you’ve spent compared to what you’ve allocated for guilt-free spending&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-invest-intelligently-with-little-work&quot;&gt;How to Invest Intelligently with Little Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section of &lt;em&gt;I Will Teach You to be Rich&lt;/em&gt;, Ramit walks us through how to invest the money in your 401ks and IRAs. It’s a good introduction to the foundational topics of investing that can be summed up in a few points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be less risk averse when you’re younger, more risk averse when older&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hardly anyone beats the market, even full-time investors so it’s not worth trying to pick the right stocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t invest in any funds with high fees, like mutual funds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;it’s better long term to invest in low-fee index funds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some diversification is good, just remember to rebalance your ratios annually&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;invest in lifecycle funds to be completely hands off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramit goes into more details on each one of these here and explains why he gives the advice he does. It’s solid financial advice and worth reading more into if you’re fresh to personal finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-personal-finance-tips&quot;&gt;Final Personal Finance Tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;try and invest as much as you can, as early as you can&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if your income increases, look to increase how much you allocate to savings first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ignore the noise of the financial industry, it can cause you to get emotional and make bad decisions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;don’t worry about tricks to avoid taxes or seeing a financial advisor until your investments total $100k+&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;create an emergency fund to protect against job loss or unexpected, expensive bills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Unlike other people, who worry about money (because they never learned how it works), you get to focus on the things you love.”&lt;/p&gt;

It seems we make our own choices. It seems we choose our beliefs. It seems we can think about what we want, when we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems everything we do is of our own free will and this all seems quite obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there does exist the opposite belief that we don’t have free will to choose all those things ourselves and rather our thoughts, beliefs, choices, and actions are determined only by a result of previous causes that could not have resulted in any other outcome. &lt;strong&gt;This philosophical belief is called determinism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned about determinism from Sam Harris and my first reaction was &lt;em&gt;no way that’s even close to being right, of course we have free will&lt;/em&gt;. But after listening to his arguments and doing my own research on determinism, I can’t help but be convinced it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This realization had such a profound effect on me it has fundamentally changed the way I think about myself, other people, and the world around me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is an examination into determinism versus free will, thought exercises to illustrate the lack of free will in our thoughts, beliefs, choices, and actions, and finally the implications of it in our daily lives and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;free-will-vs-determinism&quot;&gt;Free Will vs Determinism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism#History&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Determinism&lt;/a&gt; is the philosophical belief that any thought you have, belief you uphold, choice you make, and action you take is determined by a chain of previous causes that could not be otherwise because of those causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Free will&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, is the belief we have the unimpeded ability to control our thoughts, choose our beliefs, make choices, and take actions between different possible options. &lt;strong&gt;The key question that differentiates determinism and free will is &lt;em&gt;are you capable to have done otherwise?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Harris did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/w8Q6CWv7IXo?t=8106&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;great thought exercise on the Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate the difference. It goes like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of a city - any city in the world. &lt;em&gt;Now say it out loud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could have chosen any of the hundreds of cities you know the name of, &lt;em&gt;but you chose that one.&lt;/em&gt; Some other cities might have run through your head right before you answered, but there were hundreds that didn’t even occur to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the hundreds of possible options, this seems like an example of one of the freest choices you can make. But if we go back in time right to the moment where I first asked you to say the city out loud, &lt;em&gt;could you have chosen a different city?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you examine your thought process leading to your city of choice, you’ll find reasons that caused you to choose that city - fond memories, something you saw today, or simply how you were feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a universe with free will, you’d be capable of using those inputs to choose one city and you could have easily chosen a different city. But in a deterministic universe, we could go back 1,000 times right to the start of this thought exercise and you’d go through that same exact thought process and you’d choose that same city every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s the difference between free will and determinism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arguments-for-determinism&quot;&gt;Arguments for Determinism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are thought exercises to reveal how much of who we are, our thoughts, beliefs, choices, and actions are the product of causes rather than choices from our own free will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-didnt-choose-our-genetics-or-upbringing&quot;&gt;We didn’t choose our genetics or upbringing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, we’re alive. And it wasn’t by choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t get to choose the country or city we were born and raised in. We didn’t choose the culture. We didn’t choose the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t get to choose our genetic code, how tall we’d become, how attractive or unattractive we are, the sound of our voice, the color of our skin, the language we speak, our natural talents, our gender or sex, or the diseases we’re susceptible to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t get to choose our parents, how much or how little money they had to raise us with, their relationship between each other, the religion, values, and politics they ingrained in us, or how much or how little they pushed us in sports, music, or academics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How our parents raised us (or the people who did), heavily influence our identity, character, values, beliefs, and future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re a parent, you already know this is true or you wouldn’t have read all those books or watched all those videos on how to become a great parent. You wouldn’t have tried as hard as you did to create the best possible life for your children if you knew it wouldn’t make a difference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to think about your upbringing. How much has it made you who you are today? How much of that was your choice? How much of that was determined and out of your control?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-dont-choose-our-own-thoughts&quot;&gt;We don’t choose our own thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the part of us that feels closest to our sense of free will, our thoughts seem to be the element we have complete control of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we are in complete control of our thoughts, &lt;strong&gt;why do we struggle with staying focused and distractions? It’s not that we choose to be distracted. It happens “against our will” because we don’t have the control to choose what we think about.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’ve ever practiced meditation, you already know how frequently random thoughts surface themselves, completely outside of our control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not only do we not choose what and when we think about things, we don’t choose our opinion of things either. &lt;strong&gt;If we did have free will and complete control of choosing our opinions, marketing and advertising wouldn’t be a multi billion dollar industry fighting for our attention,&lt;/strong&gt; we wouldn’t be the average of the five people we surround ourselves with, &lt;a href=&quot;/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others&quot;&gt;social media wouldn’t affect our mental health&lt;/a&gt;, and good and bad influences wouldn’t make a difference to our character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the many things that influence every thought and opinion we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if we don’t choose the things we think about, when we think about them, and our opinions of them, how can we possibly ever have a thought or opinion formed purely from our choice alone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-dont-choose-our-own-beliefs&quot;&gt;We don’t choose our own beliefs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to think of a strong belief you have, such as a religious belief or political position. What is your best reason for believing your belief or position is right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever your best reason was, it wasn’t &lt;em&gt;because I chose to believe it,&lt;/em&gt; was it? &lt;strong&gt;That’s because we don’t choose our beliefs. We’re convinced of them. It’s only until we’re convinced of a belief that we can uphold that belief with conviction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate this is true, see if you’re capable of choosing to believe the opposite view of the belief or position you were just thinking of. Could you do it? If you believe the Earth is a sphere, can you choose to believe right now, with complete conviction, that it’s flat? The reason why you can’t is because you’ve already been presented with good reasons why it’s a sphere and good reasons why it’s not flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We need good reasons to believe something, and making a choice to believe something is never a good enough reason for a strong belief to form.&lt;/strong&gt; So what is a good enough reason?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To our detriment, a good enough reason is anything that sounds more convincing to us than what we knew before and it’s here wherein lies the problem. We can be convinced to uphold false beliefs for objectively bad reasons. These bad, but convincing, reasons are often &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;logical fallacies&lt;/a&gt; strengthened through &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourbias.is/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cognitive biases&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s why some people do believe the Earth is flat with complete conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And consider for a moment why we even have the beliefs we do in the first place. Beliefs are pushed onto us from every angle since birth from our parents, teachers and textbooks, church and church leaders, community and culture, the news media, and on and on. &lt;strong&gt;Then we have social media that exacerbates the problem by isolating us into echo chambers that feed into our confirmation bias.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, because we don’t choose which beliefs are up for consideration in the first place and we can’t choose which to uphold, it’s clear our beliefs are determined, not chosen by our own free will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-dont-make-our-own-choices&quot;&gt;We don’t make our own choices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Harris’s ‘pick a city’ thought exercise is a demonstration of how we use previous causes to make a choice. Although this is an example of one of the freest choices you can make, it is an inconsequential choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely life’s more consequential choices where we spend weeks reflecting and deliberating over the pros and cons of that choice has to be an example of using free will to make a choice, right? Let’s explore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you’re deciding which college to go to for your bachelor’s degree. The pros and cons you might be deliberating over are the schools’ prestiges, quality of major programs, how much fun you’ll have, and where your parents want you to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your genetics, upbringing, thoughts, opinions, and beliefs will determine your final assessment for each of these considerations. &lt;strong&gt;These are the tools we use to make decisions and if our decision making tools are determined, then the choices we end up making from them are determined.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, neither the time it takes to make a choice or the level of consequence in a choice’s outcome changes the fact that our choices are determined. We’re still capable of making choices in a deterministic universe, but we are never capable of choosing something else than what we do end up choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-dont-control-our-own-actions&quot;&gt;We don’t control our own actions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actions can occur either unconsciously or consciously. Unconscious actions like scratching an itch, sighing, or bouncing your leg up and down while sitting are actions that occur, without a doubt, from a cause, not by choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conscious actions require a choice to act. And if choices are determined, then actions are determined.&lt;/strong&gt; We can even make a choice to act and still fail to complete that act because causes are more powerful than our choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means we don’t have complete control of our actions or body. If we did, we wouldn’t choose to &lt;a href=&quot;/how-to-break-bad-habits&quot;&gt;break a bad habit&lt;/a&gt; and fail. We wouldn’t choose to &lt;a href=&quot;/how-to-make-habits-stick&quot;&gt;start a good habit&lt;/a&gt; and fail. We wouldn’t need to read a &lt;a href=&quot;/atomic-habits-review-notes-lessons&quot;&gt;book on habits&lt;/a&gt; at all. If we had free will and control of our actions, we could simply choose to do something and do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we don’t have control of our actions because we don’t have control of our choices. We don’t have control of our choices because we don’t have control of our beliefs. We don’t have control of our beliefs because we don’t have control of our thoughts, opinions, genetics, or how we were raised.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-the-lack-of-free-will-matter&quot;&gt;Does the Lack of Free Will Matter?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determining whether we have free will or not matters because if we do have free will, that means we should have full, moral responsibility for our actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we don’t have free will, how much moral responsibility should we bear for actions we could not have done otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Admitting that free will is an illusion actually does have some important consequences. They’re not the kind of consequences that people worry about. It’s not that you have no basis to be a better person or to change your life or to make efforts to improve yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“That all remains intact, but it does change our ethical views of good and evil in some important ways.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sam Harris, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/w8Q6CWv7IXo?t=8319&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Joe Rogan Experience #543 2:18:39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, let’s look at what the lack of free will means for our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-be-too-hard-on-yourself&quot;&gt;Don’t be too hard on yourself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be disappointed with the way you look, how much money you make, or how many followers you have. You might &lt;a href=&quot;/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others&quot;&gt;compare yourself to others&lt;/a&gt; and be disappointed with how ordinary or inadequate you are compared to them. I’ve been there and I think we’ve all been there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By understanding that we don’t have control over the causes that determine our looks, income, popularity, or status, it becomes possible to accept who we are and be grateful for what we have.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/picture&gt;
                &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;        
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most empowering tenets of Stoicism and why I’ve fully embraced its philosophy into my life is about identifying and separating the things that are up to us from what’s not. If something is not up to us and is out of our control, then we shouldn’t get angry, scared, or grieve about it because there’s nothing we could have done to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When a slave runs away from his master, we call him a fugitive slave. But the law of nature is a master too, and to break it is to become a fugitive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“To feel grief, anger, or fear is to try to escape from something decreed by the ruler of all things, now or in the past or in the future. And that ruler is law [fate], which governs what happens to each of us. To feel grief or anger or fear is to become a fugitive — a fugitive from justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius,  &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 10.25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infusing determinism and Stoicism into my perspective has shown me that getting angry, sad, and frustrated with who and where I am today would be denying that my previous causes could not have been anything else than what they were.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, these negative emotions are unnecessary. All they do is bring extra harm for no rational reason. Identifying the things that are outside of my control has &lt;a href=&quot;/virtue-is-its-own-reward&quot;&gt;ultimately brought tranquility into my life.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-good-to-other-people&quot;&gt;Be good to other people&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just as you recognize the things you can’t control about yourself, it’s just as powerful to recognize other people are the way they are and do the things they do because of causes outside of their control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So think about that the next time your significant other, a family member, friend, or coworker does something you find weird or wrong. It doesn’t seem weird or wrong to them because of their previous causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to choose [how to react].”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius,  &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 7.22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have objectively good reasons for thinking whatever they’re doing is weird or wrong, they may just not know better and that’s okay. If you’re able to, try and steer them in the right direction. &lt;strong&gt;The worst thing you can do for your relationship and your own well-being, is pass blame.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If it’s in your control, why do you do it? If it’s in someone else’s, then who are you blaming? Atoms? The gods? Stupid either way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Blame no one. Set people straight, if you can. If not, just repair the damage. And suppose you can’t do that either. Then where does blaming people get you?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius,  &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 8.17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeing the universe, yourself, and other people through a lens of determinism and Stoicism adds a priceless attribute to your character: empathy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-more-aware-of-what-influences-you&quot;&gt;Be more aware of what influences you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally everything and everyone around us is influencing our thoughts, beliefs, and behavior in every moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pay attention to your thoughts and emotions throughout the day. Try to understand what made you think and feel that way.&lt;/em&gt; By being able to identify the cause, we can cut out the negative influences and increase the positive ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius often draws a comparison between being unaware of your influences to “being jerked like a puppet by our own impulses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s time you realized that you have something in you more powerful and miraculous than the things that affect you and make you dance like a puppet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“What’s in my thoughts at this moment? Fear? Jealousy? Desire? Feelings like that?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius,  &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 12.19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “power” he’s referring to is our ability to be aware of these influences and how we choose to react to them. This is a skill that takes practice. Meditation is the most popular method to get better at it, but I’ve found &lt;a href=&quot;/stoic-journal-topics&quot;&gt;daily journaling&lt;/a&gt; to work better for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly realized social media and video games were some of my biggest negative influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the expense of losing touch with some friends, I deleted Snapchat and Instagram because it made me &lt;a href=&quot;/stop-comparing-yourself-to-others&quot;&gt;care too much about what other people think of me&lt;/a&gt;, envy the lives other people live and the things they have, and lose gratitude for who I am and what I have in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sold my Playstation because all I wanted to do was game when I got off work. I realized it was an unproductive use of time and losing online games would leave me annoyed and frustrated (FIFA players understand).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-on-politics-and-society&quot;&gt;Impact on politics and society&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perspective of empathy through determinism and Stoicism can be extended to people who live on the opposite side of the globe, who we don’t understand, and who society deems bad. Through practicing this perspective, it’s possible to develop empathy for these people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, people in jail for committing crimes have previous causes that led them to do so, whether those crimes are theft, drug related, or assault. While determinism doesn’t mean our society must rid all fault and responsibility from those who commit crimes, but maybe we should emphasize an approach of rehabilitation more than punishment in our criminal justice system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should be more empathetic to people who were born in a third world country through no choice of their own. Maybe we should be more empathetic to people who have different religious beliefs and political positions due to causes outside of their control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some critics say there isn’t much of a practical difference between free will and the illusion of it, there are clear implications to the understanding of ourselves, other people, and the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge yourself to be aware of the influences on your thoughts, beliefs, and behavior. Challenge yourself to accept and be grateful for who you are, what you have, and what you’ve accomplished. Challenge yourself to feel affection for other people even when they make mistakes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Reggie Paquette</name></author><category term="[&quot;all&quot;]" /><summary type="html">It seems we have control of our actions.

&lt;p&gt;Or in other words, build the biggest legacy. &lt;strong&gt;And if my life ended without a legacy, if there wasn’t a large subset of people who remembered me or knew who I was even just 50 years after I died, my life was… well meaningless.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a demoralizing point-of-view, but I couldn’t reason or justify a better measurement for meaning. I’d rather accept a harsh reality as true than keep my head in the sand and believe a false reality to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I was conflicted when reading how strong &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Marcus Aurelius&lt;/a&gt; and the Stoics believed accepting fate and doing good as the highest objective he strived to achieve in life. This is one of my favorite Aurelius quotes about this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be good. Like gold or emerald or purple repeating to itself, “No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be emerald, my color undiminished.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 7.15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this quote because he says his task is to be good, like an emerald’s task is to be emerald in color. An emerald can’t be anything but emerald. And Aurelius strives to be good to his core so he couldn’t do anything but good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I didn’t understand how striving to achieve virtue could lead to a meaningful life. But then I understood Aurelius didn’t seek to achieve meaning. &lt;strong&gt;Rather, he sought to achieve goodness.&lt;/strong&gt; So what did Aurelius know about meaning to disregard it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;according-to-marcus-aurelius-life-and-legacy-are-trivial-and-meaningless&quot;&gt;According to Marcus Aurelius, Life and Legacy are Trivial and Meaningless&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s my understanding that Aurelius never believed in a “meaningful” life. In one meditation, he equated the entirety of life to a rock being thrown in the air and coming back down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A rock thrown in the air. It loses nothing by coming down, gained nothing by going up.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 9.17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another, he wrote about exercising awareness in the moment, not to appreciate it, but to realize it’s not much to miss out on when he dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Stop whatever you’re doing for a moment and ask yourself: Am I afraid of death because I won’t be able to do this anymore?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 10.29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the impression Aurelius believed life was something that had to be done and put up with as fate demanded. Why? Because death scared him and he wanted to believe he wouldn’t be missing out on anything when he died to better cope with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Human lives are brief and trivial. Yesterday a blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid, ash.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it up without complaint.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 4.48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-aurelius-had-to-say-about-legacy-and-fame&quot;&gt;What Aurelius had to say about legacy and fame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacies are born out of fame and Aurelius had a disdain for it for two reasons. If you’re working towards achieving fame, it means you care too much about what other people think of you. And second, fame doesn’t last long so it’s pointless to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…look at how soon we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us - how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space…”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 4.3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter if people remember you 50 years after death or 200, you will still be forgotten. Think about how many people you know the names of who were alive 200 years ago in 1819. There was a billion people alive in the world then. Can you name more than five?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“So many who were remembered already forgotten, and those who remembered them long gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-criticisms-of-marcus-aureliuss-point-of-view&quot;&gt;My Criticisms of Marcus Aurelius’s Point-of-View&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on my interpretation of Aurelius’s beliefs, legacy, fame, and being remembered is meaningless. And life itself is void of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only criticism is you can take two people, and objectively determine which had more impact, and thus more meaning. For example, taken to the extreme, it’s easy to identify who had more impact and meant more to society: Steve Jobs vs the average joe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to point out that impact could be positive or negative. For example, Martin Luther King Jr vs Osama Bin Laden. Both had great impact on society, but in opposite directions. If, for sake of argument, we quantified their impact as equal would their meaning be equal? Does meaning take into account positive vs negative impact? I think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius and the Stoics believed being virtuous and doing good as the highest objective. &lt;strong&gt;Then, according to Stoicism, wouldn’t someone who does more good than another have both more impact and more meaning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stoics argued that the only thing in our control is our mind. And it’s rare for people to make an impact at the level of Jobs or MLK. If all it took to make a high impact was desire and tenacity, there would be a lot more people making that high of an impact. But there are lot of factors outside of our control, which makes the highest level of achievement impossible for most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, while there may be objective measures to determine if a life is more impactful or meaningful than another, it’s fruitless to pursue it and make it your highest objective. Instead, the Stoics argue it’s best to make virtue and doing good the highest objective, which is entirely within our control. I’m beginning to understand why.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-how-virtue-is-its-own-reward&quot;&gt;Understanding How Virtue is Its Own Reward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailystoic.com/4-stoic-virtues/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ryan Holiday puts it&lt;/a&gt;, “A Stoic believes they don’t control the world around them, only how they respond — and that they must always respond with courage, temperance, wisdom, and justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the four core virtues of Stoicism. Aurelius believed &lt;strong&gt;justice&lt;/strong&gt; was the most important, because acting with justice is doing good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“And a commitment to justice in your own acts. Which means: thought and action resulting in the common good. What you were born to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 9.31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completed &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations&lt;/a&gt; for the first time two years ago. Since then, I’ve been adopting a Stoic mindset and I’ve seen myself undergo a dramatic transformation. Acting with justice and virtue has given me a new level of patience and resilience, improved my relationships, and fostered an affection for all people. It has redirected my ambition from building a legacy and longing for recognition to a mission of doing good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing out how acting with justice has helped me in all these ways, but I can’t explain it better than Marcus Aurelius himself. Here are some of my favorite meditations on doing good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to choose.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 7.22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you’ll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger. Your sense of good and evil may be the same as theirs, or near it, in which case you have to excuse them. Or your sense of good and evil may differ from theirs. In which case they’re misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 7.26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To do harm is to do yourself harm. To do an injustice is to do yourself an injustice - it degrades you.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 9.4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When faced with people’s bad behavior, turn around ask when &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; have acted like that. When you saw money as good, or pleasure, or social position. Your anger will subside as soon as you recognize that they acted under compulsion (what else could they do?)…”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 10.30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“That you don’t know for sure it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a mistake. A lot of things are means to some other end. You have to know an awful lot before you can judge other people’s actions with real understanding.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marcus Aurelius, &lt;a href=&quot;/meditations-from-marcus-aurelius-summary-notes-quotes&quot;&gt;Meditations 11.18.v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you believe doing good as the highest objective, you feel good when you do it. &lt;strong&gt;Acting with justice and virtue is its own reward because acting virtuously is synonymous with doing good to others and preserving your integrity. With self fulfillment and happiness as a bonus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What is the goal of virtue, after all, except a life that flows smoothly?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Epictetus, Book I, 108&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave you with one last meditation that sums up Aurelius’s and the Stoics point-of-view and reason for doing good as the highest objective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…And how does it injure you anyway? You’ll find that none of the people you’re upset about has done anything that could do damage to your mind. But that’s all that “harm” or “injury” could mean. Yes, boorish people do boorish things. What’s strange or unheard of about that? Isn’t it yourself you should reproach - for not anticipating that they’d act this way? The logos gave you the means to see it - that a person would act a given way - but you paid no attention. And now you’re astonished that he’s gone and done it. So when you call someone “untrustworthy” or “ungrateful,” turn the reproach on yourself. It was you who did wrong. By assuming that someone with those traits deserved your trust. Or by doing them a favor and expecting something in return, instead of looking to the action itself for your reward. What else did you expect from helping someone out? Isn’t it enough that you’ve done what your nature demands? You want a salary for it, too? As if your eyes expected a reward for seeing, or your feet for walking. That’s what they were made for. By doing what they were designed to do, they’re performing their function. Whereas humans were made to help others. And when we do help others - or help them to do something - we’re doing what we were designed for. We perform our function.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask “what needs to be done?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask “what is right for the company?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop action plans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take responsibility for decisions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take responsibility for communicating&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on opportunities rather than problems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run productive meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think and say “we” rather than “I”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two give you the knowledge you need. The next four convert that knowledge into effective action. The last two gets your team to feel responsible and inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Effective Executive, Drucker explains what an effective executive is and how to become one. He believed being an effective executive could be learned and this book served as a handbook to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Executives are doers; they execute. Knowledge is useless to executives until it has been translated into deeds. But before springing into action, the executive needs to plan his course. He needs to think about desired results, probable restraints, future revisions, check-in points, and implications for how he’ll spend his time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-makes-an-executive-effective&quot;&gt;What Makes an Executive Effective?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking “what do I want to do?” ask “what has to be done?” This is crucial for managerial success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The answer to this question “…almost always contains more than one urgent task. But effective executives do not splinter themselves. They concentrate on one task if at all possible. […] I have never encountered an executive who remains effective while tackling more than two tasks at a time. Hence, after asking what needs to be done, the effective executive sets priorities and sticks to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have the top initiatives prioritized, you need to choose which you are especially good at undertaking and then delegate the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives try to focus on jobs they’ll do especially well. They know that enterprises perform if top management performs—and don’t if it doesn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-is-the-beginning-of-your-action-plan&quot;&gt;This is the beginning of your action plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your action plan is a prioritized list of initiatives and tasks for you and your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The action plan is a statement of intentions rather than a commitment. It must not become a straitjacket. It should be revised often, because every success creates new opportunities. So does every failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Develop the plan in a tool that makes it easy to check-in, provide updates, and move items around as it progresses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Napoleon allegedly said that no successful battle ever followed its plan. Yet Napoleon also planned every one of his battles, far more meticulously than any earlier general had done. Without an action plan, the executive becomes a prisoner of events. And without check-ins to reexamine the plan as events unfold, the executive has no way of knowing which events really matter and which are only noise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And an action plan is useless unless it’s communicated and understood by your teams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decision has not really been made until people know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who is accountable for delivering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the deadline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who and which teams are affected by the decision and therefore have to understand and approve it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;who else should be informed of the decision, even if not directly affected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action plan shouldn’t be given as an order from the top. Get and incorporate feedback. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives make sure that both their action plans and their information needs are understood. Specifically, this means that they share their plans with and ask for comments from all their colleagues—superiors, subordinates, and peers. At the same time, they let each person know what information they’ll need to get the job done. The information flow from subordinate to boss is usually what gets the most attention. But executives need to pay equal attention to peers’ and superiors’ information needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although problems stick out like a nail begging to be hammered, don’t make fixing a problem a top priority.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Good executives focus on opportunities rather than problems. Problems have to be taken care of, of course; they must not be swept under the rug. But problem solving, however necessary, does not produce results. It prevents damage. Exploiting opportunities produces results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when delegating tasks…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives put their best people on opportunities rather than on problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Drucker recalls how an effective executive would run a meeting, he thinks back on an old colleague of his.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“At the beginning of a formal meeting, Sloan announced the meeting’s purpose. He then listened. He never took notes and he rarely spoke except to clarify a confusing point. At the end he summed up, thanked the participants, and left. Then he immediately wrote a short memo addressed to one attendee of the meeting. In that note, he summarized the discussion and its conclusions and spelled out any work assignment decided upon in the meeting (including a decision to hold another meeting on the subject or to study an issue). He specified the deadline and the executive who was to be accountable for the assignment. He sent a copy of the memo to everyone who’d been present at the meeting. It was through these memos—each a small masterpiece—that Sloan made himself into an outstandingly effective executive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;effectiveness-can-be-learned&quot;&gt;Effectiveness Can Be Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing to come up with a good idea. It’s another thing all together to execute that idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself achievement. […] Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;effective-executive-are-masters-of-their-time&quot;&gt;Effective Executive Are Masters of Their Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the most out of your time and your team’s time is an essential first step to becoming effecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[Effective executives] start with their time. And they do not start out with planning. They start by finding out where their time actually goes. Then they attempt to manage their time and to cut back unproductive demands on their time. Finally they consolidate their “discretionary” time into the largest possible continuing units.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To master your time, follow this three step process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;record your time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;manage your time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;consolidate your time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The first step toward executive effectiveness is therefore to record actual time-use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tips-on-recording-time&quot;&gt;Tips on Recording Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measure it in real-time, not later from memory&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recording time is a habit that can improve with constant effort&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out how to make time management systematic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve been recording your time, you can analyze it and see what the time wasters are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To find these time-wastes, one asks of all activities in the time records: ‘What would happen if this were not done at all?’ And if the answer is, ‘Nothing would happen,’ then obviously the conclusion is to stop doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then determine which of the activities left can be delegated to some else. Now you can see how much time you have for important tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The executive who records and analyzes his time and then attempts to manage it can determine how much he has for his important tasks. How much time is there that is “discretionary,” that is, available for the big tasks that will really make a contribution? It is not going to be a great deal, no matter how ruthlessly the executive prunes time-wasters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drucker discovered that it’s much more effective to block open time in as large of chunks as possible to get into deep work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The effective executive therefore knows that he has to consolidate his [open] time. He knows that he needs large chunks of time and that small driblets are no time at all. Even one quarter of the working day, if consolidated in large time units, is usually enough to get the important things done. But even three quarters of the working day are useless if they are only available as fifteen minutes here or half an hour there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Time is the scarcest resource, and unless it is managed, nothing else can be managed. The analysis of one’s time, moreover, is the one easily accessible and yet systematic way to analyze one’s work and to think through what really matters in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executives-are-also-responsible-for-their-teams-time&quot;&gt;Executives are Also Responsible for Their Team’s Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common time waste is when the executive wastes his individual team members’ time. To overcome this, Drucker advises executives to directly as their team if and how he/she wastes their time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives have learned to ask systematically and without coyness: “What do I do that wastes your time without contributing to your effectiveness?” To ask this question, and to ask it without being afraid of the truth, is a mark of the effective executive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tips-on-managing-meetings&quot;&gt;Tips on Managing Meetings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like to be “in the know” and aware of what’s going on. Effective executives should let the whole team know when a meeting will take place and on what topic. Make it optional for people to join so they don’t feel left out. In any case, summarize the meeting notes, send to the team, and allow for questions and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Meetings are by definition a concession to deficient organization for one either meets or one works. One cannot do both at the same time. In an ideally designed structure (which in a changing world is of course only a dream) there would be no meetings. Everybody would know what he needs to know to do his job. Everyone would have the resources available to him to do his job. We meet because people holding different jobs have to cooperate to get a specific task done. We meet because the knowledge and experience needed in a specific situation are not available in one head, but have to be pieced together out of the experience and knowledge of several people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to run meetings effectively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The effective man always states at the outset of a meeting the specific purpose and contribution it is to achieve. He makes sure that the meeting addresses itself to this purpose. He does not allow a meeting called to inform to degenerate into a “bull session” in which everyone has bright ideas. But a meeting called by him to stimulate thinking and ideas also does not become simply a presentation on the part of one of the members, but is run to challenge and stimulate everybody in the room. He always, at the end of his meetings, goes back to the opening statement and relates the final conclusions to the original intent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-effective-executive-focuses-on-contribution&quot;&gt;The Effective Executive Focuses on Contribution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective executive are always focusing on contribution that makes a positive impact on the company’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The man who focuses on efforts and who stresses his downward authority is a subordinate no matter how exalted his title and rank. But the man who focuses on contribution and who takes responsibility for results, no matter how junior, is in the most literal sense of the phrase, “top management.” He holds himself accountable for the performance of the whole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to achieve that, you can’t only look inward to what you want to do and what you think you can do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The focus on contribution turns the executive’s attention away from his own specialty, his own narrow skills, his own department, and toward the performance of the whole. It turns his attention to the outside, the only place where there are results. He is likely to have to think through what relationships his skills, his specialty, his function, or his department have to the entire organization and its purpose. He therefore will also come to think in terms of the customer, the client, or the patient, who is the ultimate reason for whatever the organization produces, whether it be economic goods, governmental policies, or health services. As a result, what he does and how he does it will be materially different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-areas-of-contribution&quot;&gt;Three Areas of Contribution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;direct results&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;value building and reaffirmation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;developing people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If deprived of performance in any one of these areas, it will decay and die. All three therefore have to be built into the contribution of every executive. But their relative importance varies greatly with the personality and the position of the executive as well as with the needs of the organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you focus on contribution, it will help you fulfill the four basic requirements of effective human relations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;communications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;teamwork&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;self-development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;development of others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping others be successful:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Effective executives find themselves asking other people in the organization, their superiors, their subordinates, but above all, their colleagues in other areas: ‘What contribution from me do you require to make your contribution to the organization? When do you need this, how do you need it, and in what form?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all, the biggest benefit of focusing on contribution is it counteracts chaos and highlights what’s important to spend time on versus what’s noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The focus on contribution imposes an organizing principle. It imposes relevance on events. Focusing on contribution turns one of the inherent weaknesses of the executive’s situation—his dependence on other people, his being within the organization—into a source of strength. It creates a team. Finally, focusing on contribution fights the temptation to stay within the organization. It leads the executive—especially the top-level man—to lift his eyes from the inside of efforts, work, and relationships, to the outside; that is, to the results of the organization. It makes him try hard to have direct contact with the outside—whether markets and customers, patients in a community, or the various “publics” which are the outside of a government agency. To focus on contribution is to focus on effectiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-strengths-productive&quot;&gt;Making Strengths Productive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drucker makes the argument that it’s best to build on strengths to achieve results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The effective executive fills positions and promotes on the basis of what a man can do. He does not make staffing decisions to minimize weaknesses but to maximize strength.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;staffing-for-strength&quot;&gt;Staffing for Strength&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two rules to staff for strengths:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look for strength in one major area. Ask, ‘what can this person do uncommonly well?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make each job demanding with a deep scope so their strengths can produce significant results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…every people-decision is a gamble. By basing it on what a man can do, it becomes at least a rational gamble.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spotting-team-members-not-using-their-strengths&quot;&gt;Spotting Team Members Not Using Their Strengths&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s your responsibility to spot and guide those on your team who aren’t making their strength’s productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The ones who are enthusiastic and who, in turn, have results to show for their work, are the ones whose abilities are being challenged and used. Those that are deeply frustrated all say, in one way or another: ‘My abilities are not being put to use.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s your job to know when this is happening, correct it, and be ahead of it so it’s unlikely to occur again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The assertion that “somebody else will not let me do anything” should always be suspected as a cover-up for inertia. But even where the situation does set limitations—and everyone lives and works within rather stringent limitations—there are usually important, meaningful, pertinent things that can be done. The effective executive looks for them. If he starts out with the question: “What can I do?” he is almost certain to find that he can actually do much more than he has time and resources for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-things-first&quot;&gt;First Things First&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effectiveness is reached by focusing on one thing at time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Concentration is necessary precisely because the executive faces so many tasks clamoring to be done. For doing one thing at a time means doing it fast. The more one can concentrate time, effort, and resources, the greater the number and diversity of tasks one can actually perform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you don’t focus on one thing at a time, you end up working harder and at the same time get nothing done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The people who get nothing done often work a great deal harder. In the first place, they underestimate the time for any one task. They always expect that everything will go right. Yet, as every executive knows, nothing ever goes right. The unexpected always happens—the unexpected is indeed the only thing one can confidently expect. And almost never is it a pleasant surprise. Effective executives therefore allow a fair margin of time beyond what is actually needed. In the second place, the typical (that is, the more or less ineffectual) executive tries to hurry—and that only puts him further behind. Effective executives do not race. They set an easy pace but keep going steadily. Finally, the typical executive tries to do several things at once. Therefore, he never has the minimum time quantum for any of the tasks in his program. If any one of them runs into trouble, his entire program collapses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always stay updated to the current programs, activities, and tasks. If something isn’t worth doing anymore, it’s better to stop it sooner than later and refocus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Systematic sloughing off of the old is the one and only way to force the new. There is no lack of ideas in any organization I know. “Creativity” is not our problem. But few organizations ever get going on their own good ideas. Everybody is much too busy on the tasks of yesterday. Putting all programs and activities regularly on trial for their lives and getting rid of those that cannot prove their productivity work wonders in stimulating creativity even in the most hidebound bureaucracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;big-quote&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Concentration—that is, the courage to impose on time and events his own decision as to what really matters and comes first—is the executive’s only hope of becoming the master of time and events instead of their whipping boy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-elements-of-decision-making&quot;&gt;The Elements of Decision-Making&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drucker has a lot to say on decision making and how to do it effecively. I found these two sections way too long and verbose for my attention span. Although, I really like the below quote about how data-driven decisions should be seen as having a degree of risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Finding the appropriate measurement is thus not a mathematical exercise. It is a risk-taking judgment. Whenever one has to judge, one must have alternatives among which one can choose. A judgment in which one can only say “yes” or “no” is no judgment at all. Only if there are alternatives can one hope to get insight into what is truly at stake. Effective executives therefore insist on alternatives of measurement—so that they can choose the one appropriate one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-topics-on-effectiveness-that-stood-out-to-me&quot;&gt;Other Topics on Effectiveness that Stood Out to Me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generalist-vs-specialist&quot;&gt;Generalist vs specialist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The only meaningful definition of a “generalist” is a specialist who can relate his own small area to the universe of knowledge. Maybe a few people have knowledge in more than a few small areas. But that does not make them generalists; it makes them specialists in several areas. And one can be just as bigoted in three areas as in one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allowing-people-to-take-risks&quot;&gt;Allowing people to take risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Executives also owe it to the organization and to their fellow workers not to tolerate nonperforming individuals in important jobs. It may not be the employees’ fault that they are underperforming, but even so, they have to be removed. People who have failed in a new job should be given the choice to go back to a job at their former level and salary. This option is rarely exercised; such people, as a rule, leave voluntarily, at least when their employers are U.S. firms. But the very existence of the option can have a powerful effect, encouraging people to leave safe, comfortable jobs and take risky new assignments. The organization’s performance depends on employees’ willingness to take such chances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;developing-people&quot;&gt;Developing people&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“An executive’s focus on contribution by itself is a powerful force in developing people. People adjust to the level of the demands made on them. The executive who sets his sights on contribution raises the sights and standards of everyone with whom he works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…executives who take responsibility for contribution in their own work will as a rule demand that their subordinates take responsibility too. They will tend to ask their men: “What are the contributions for which this organization and I, your superior, should hold you accountable? What should we expect of you? What is the best utilization of your knowledge and your ability?” And then communication becomes possible, becomes indeed easy. Once the subordinate has thought through what contribution should be expected of him, the superior has, of course, both the right and the responsibility to judge the validity of the proposed contribution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“A superior has responsibility for the work of others. He also has power over the careers of others. Making strengths productive is therefore much more than an essential of effectiveness. It is a moral imperative, a responsibility of authority and position. To focus on weakness is not only foolish; it is irresponsible. A superior owes it to his organization to make the strength of every one of his subordinates as productive as it can be. But even more does he owe it to the human beings over whom he exercises authority to help them get the most out of whatever strength they may have.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Released in July 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/&quot;&gt;Netlify Analytics&lt;/a&gt; is a new add-on to Netlify’s popular hosting and deployment platform. Starting at $9/month, it’s an “expensive” alternative to the analytics king, Google Analytics, which is free. But is it worth it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought it to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-good-about-netlify-analytics&quot;&gt;What is Good About Netlify Analytics?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netlify Analytics doesn’t slow down your website at all since you don’t need to add any code to your site. Installation was as easy as clicking a button in my Netlify backend. And since it’s anonymous and doesn’t use javascript or cookies, users with adblock are still counted and I didn’t need to add any cookie warnings on my site for GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-can-see-in-netlify-analytics&quot;&gt;What You Can See in Netlify Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pageviews&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;unique visitors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;top viewed pages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;top pages/resources not found&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;top sources/referrers (with path)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bandwidth used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-cant-you-see-in-netlify-analytics&quot;&gt;What Can’t You See in Netlify Analytics?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you can’t see beyond the last 30 days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can’t filter by page or change the date range&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can’t look at the top sources for an individual page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can’t see the bounce rate or average time on site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-netlify-analytics-worth-it&quot;&gt;Is Netlify Analytics Worth It?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Not right now. At $9/month for a product whose competitors are free and more capable, everyone was expecting more from this release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure no-dark-filter figure--wide gtc-1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/webp/netlify-analytics-pricing.webp&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;source srcset=&quot;/assets/images/netlify-analytics-pricing.jpg&quot; type=&quot;image/jpg&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;image &quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/netlify-analytics-pricing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Netlify Analytics starts at $9/month.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/picture&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Netlify Analytics starts at $9/month.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You only have one “screen” without a single filter to segment your data.&lt;/strong&gt; Most egregious though is they delete data older than 30 days (or at least it’s not accessible). Second, I need to be able to break down referrer and pageviews by URL so I can see from where and how much traffic specific pages are getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is now, Netlify Analytics is a great product for people who have a simple curiosity for a site or project’s stats. And if you really care about shaving milliseconds off load times or capturing ad block users, Netlify Analytics could be for you. But if you just casually need analytics, are you going to pay $9/month for it? I’m not sure it’s worth it, but many people are happy to give Netlify $9/month for Analytics because their free hosting and deployment platform is so good that they just want to support them. It’s not all bad news for Netlify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But remember, this is version one of Netlify Analytics. If Netlify can improve the product by adding the above features, it very well could be a game changer - something I’m eagerly anticipating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alternatives-to-netlify-analytics&quot;&gt;Alternatives to Netlify Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/fathom-analytics-review&quot;&gt;Fathom Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://simpleanalytics.com/&quot;&gt;Simple Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although both Fathom and Simple Analytics are not server-side analytics, they are both GDPR compliant and focused on user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just signed up for Fathom and will do a review soon to see how it compares to Netlify Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1/28//2020:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been using Fathom Analytics for seven months now. Although it’s not server-side analytics, it’s a cookie-less, privacy-focused Google Analytics alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
