"Reggie has been an invaluable part of the ServiceTitan team for over two years. I've enjoyed working with him and watching him grow as a marketer. Reggie is a true asset to any growing marketing team in a start-up environment. He has a deep knowledge of marketing automation and has become skilled in adwords and SEO. By far, though, Reggie's biggest asset to the team has been his ability to find and implement new tools to solve specific business problems. He combines a love of marketing and technology with a keen interest in optimizing systems. This served us well on multiple project he drove: launching our Facebook ad instance (which grew into our biggest channel on his watch), implementing a chat bot on our website and automating the lead capture with both Hubspot and SFDC, and building out a robust demo request form automation that captured data from leads, pushed it through Hubspot and into SFDC, and alerted the SDR team of new leads in the queue. It's been great to watch Reggie grow as he's tackled bigger and bigger projects over his time at ServiceTitan, and always with an eye to drive value with each initiative."
