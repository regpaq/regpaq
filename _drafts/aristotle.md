As I read more about philosophy through Bertrand Russell's [History of Western Philosophy](https://amzn.to/2Olnlgo){:target="_blank"}, and in particular learning about Aristotle and his work on ethics, I'm beginning to understand the practical benefits of virtue. Before I get any further, here's the main virtues from Aristotle.

## List of Virtues and Vices from Aristotle

Aristotle was the first philosopher to formalize the study of a person's character. He called it ēthikós (ethics).

His ideas and work on the subject were published in a collection of ten short books called [Nicomachean Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics){:target=“_blank”}.

I haven't read the direct text yet, but his idea of describing virtue as a mean between two vices of deficiency and excess is recognized as one of his greatest contributions to philosophy.

| Situation            | Vice of Deficiency  | Virtue                | Vice of Excess |
|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Danger               | Cowardice           | Courage               | Rashness       |
| Pleasure and Pain    | Inhibition          | Temperance            | Overindulgence |
| Getting and Spending | Illiberality        | Liberality            | Prodigality    |
| Getting and Spending | Pettiness           | Magnificence          | Vulgairty      |
| Honor and Dishonor   | Pusillanimity       | Magnanimity           | Vanity         |
| Anger                | Apathy              | Patience              | Irascibility   |
| Self Expression      | Understatement      | Truthfulness          | Boastfulness   |
| Conversation         | Boorishness         | Wittiness             | Buffoonery     |
| Social Conduct       | Rudeness            | Friendliness          | Obsequiousness |
| Shame                | Shamelessness       | Modesty               | Shyness        |
| Indignation          | Malicious enjoyment | Righteous indignation | Envy           |

His work continues to be a radically positive influence on my own philosophy and character, but I'm still not completely convinced living according to fate and being virtuous results in a meaningful life on its own.

**This article will be like a thought exercise where I work through and unpack this idea and see if I can make sense of it.** Perhaps it can change my view as I begin to understand it.

In this introduction, I briefly touched on my personal philosophy and how Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism view things differently. Before moving on to see what they think, I want to expand and clarify a few concepts from my philosophy to make it easier to compare and contrast our ideas.

## The Difference Between Life's Purpose, a Meaningful Life, and Impact

### The pupose of life

Typically when people think about this topic, they think of the purpose of life, so I want to address it. **I don't think there is a purpose of life.** Purpose could refer to a collective purpose of human life. Or it could refer to the purpose of an individual's life implying we have a predetermined reason for why each one of us are alive. I don't think either of these are true. "Why are we here?" is the wrong question to ask.

Instead of thinking we have a purpose to fulfill in life, I argue we have a goal to achieve. This article is an attempt to determine what that goal is.

### A meaningful life

A possible goal that I believe makes the most sense is to do something meaningful. **What determines a meaningful life from a meaningless one is difficult to define.** According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, meaning is defined as "significant quality." In order to understand what a life of significant quality is, we need two things: 1) to accept there are significant and insignificant lives, and 2) a way to determine one from the other.

### An impactful life

**One possible measurement for determining if a life is of significant quality or of insignificant quality is by the level of impact one had made in their life.** And impact can be defined as making a change, difference, or being an influence on something, but it's unclear how signficant that something must be in order to "qualify" as a substantial enough impact.

I see four levels of impact.

1. in the individual
2. on the family
3. on the community
4. on the world

If impact is a useful metric for measuring meaning, the question here would be at which of these levels would one have to make an impact for their life to have a material meaning?

Although I haven't even yet demonstrated meaning is a worthwhile objective in life or whether impact is a valid measurement for meaning, let's move on to see what Marcus Aurelius thought before continuing down this path.

## Does Living a Virtuous Life Bring Happiness?
Living virtuously is difficult. It takes self control, sacrifice, patience, and practice. Attempting to be more virtuous, I started approaching my relationships, work, and problems. It's a challening process. Like quitting a bad habit and having withdrawls. **But what has become instantly clear to me, without a doubt, is that living virtuously prevents unhappiness.**
