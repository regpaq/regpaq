### Competitor Pages

Competitor pages are one the lowest hanging fruit SEO/content strategies that so many brands are missing out on.

One of the last things buyers do before they make a purchase, after they've identified their problem and the type of solution they want, they look at competing products and services to make sure they're buying the right one for them. Making competitor pages serves content for these exact queries.

This type of content is a definitive example of bottom of the funnel (BOFU) content. By its nature, it won't generate a large amount of traffic, but the traffic it does generate is much more likely to sign up for a trial because they are in the buying phase of the buyer's journey. That's why this content is so important.

At Revealbot, we built six competitor pages plus a competitor "homepage" where we compare Revealbot to all our competitors and link to each separate competitor page. Here's what two of them look like:



You'll see they target keywords such as **[competitor] alternative** and **Revealbot vs [competitor**]**. All our competitor pages use the same layout. What's different between each one is different highlighted benefits/features that stand out from the competitor and data in the comparison table. You'll also notice that we don't just trash talk our competitor. We give the user a fair review and use case to choose our competitor over us. This builds trust in the eyes of our users.

And here's what the competitor homepage looks like:



Each competitor page is SEO optimized. On their own, they won't generate a lot of backlinks so it's important to give them a lot of internal links. The easiest way we did this was by linking them in the footer.

These competitor pages quickly became our highest customer generating pages, other than our homepage and feature pages.
