"Reggie has a very unique ability as a marketer to not just stay in his bubble, or only see things from a marketing point of view. Rather he does a great job of working cross-functionally, and also coming up with ideas that will have a positive impact across the company, not just his Org. 

Whether it’s split testing, conversion rate optimization, keywords, organic, whatever, he can do it, do it fast, and do it well. I also like his eye for metrics, no vanity metrics coming from this guy! 

He has a ongoing desire to continue to learn, and we had many conversations on different books, conferences, and techniques to improve the marketing program. Something else that is great with working with Reggie is understanding and quick implementation of technology, there were more times I cant where I said “Hey Reggie can you help me with this” and his response was “Already done KD, continue along your merry way”

He is an incredibly talented, proactive and intelligent marketer that I would GLADLY work with again at any time."
