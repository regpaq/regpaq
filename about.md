Why am I writing articles? It’s not to sell anything. It’s not to build an audience for a book. It’s not because I want to be famous. I publish an article every Thursday because I like to read, take notes, and share what I learned. I like to write for and to myself. When I refer to “you” in my writing, I’m thinking of myself. First and foremost, these are notes to remind myself the lessons I’ve learned over the years. Secondly, these lessons were helpful to me and they may be helpful to someone else, hence why this is public. Lastly, It can be an act as a portfolio or an inside view of who I am + how I think to colleagues and future employers. If you’re reading this, I hope you find my writing helpful in some way. Please don’t hesitate to reach out and say hi on Twitter. I’d love to meet you! https://twitter.com/regpaq
